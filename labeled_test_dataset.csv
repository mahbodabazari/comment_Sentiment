"Shahrojan, I started getting really hopeless lately; We ordered the Tahchin Morgh to test, which had nothing special whatsoever, as I expected. The food has lost the color and taste it used to have, but that's not in your hand due to expensive Saffron. However, I wonder about the Qeymeh meat. As far as I remember, it used to be boneless thigh meat; What is this meat they put in Qeymeh? It was both dry and bad looking, and it didn't taste like Qeymeh. You just felt like eating meat with plain rice! Stop doing this; you'll ruin the customer's expectation",Negative
The drink was not delivered with my food. The food was also very cold,Negative

The first-time purchase discount coupon for this restaurant, which was a serving of kebab, was not added to the invoice and only two skewers of kebab were brought without rice. These two skewers of kebab were just two skewers of kebab that were thrown in the middle of a container, without greens or even bread. Fortunately, the Snap Food support team agreed to send the free serving but! The next masterpiece was that they said you have to charge your account seven thousand tomans for the courier.

Of course, with all this fuss, their kebab is delicious",Positive

"I really didn’t think their food would be of such poor quality. I expect the support team of this application that before allowing restaurants to register for accepting orders, they must visit their stage. Neither the hotdog was 90% nor it had the mentioned quality. 90% of the food went to trash. The 10% that was usable was its beverage and a bit of its French fries and that was due to hunger.

"As for the quality of the food, I was satisfied. It was both fresh and tasty, but I was not satisfied with the delivery process at all. I had preordered for a time slot of 8:15 to 8:45 pm. However, unfortunately, without any regard to the customer’s request, they delivered the order at 7:45 pm! If you intend to send orders at your own discretion, without paying attention to the time specified by the customer, please kindly remove the preorder time option from the app. This is because my order completely turned cold during the 45-minute time slot that it should have been consumed by the guest… I hope that with a follow-up mentioned by the support team, this problem will not be repeated for the third time, and that it will be followed up seriously and fundamentally because just as late food delivery causes displeasure, early delivery also disrupts the customer’s schedule",Negative

SnappFood creates motivation for shopping with its discounts but the supermarkets it partners with are weak. Both their product variety is limited and they do not offer any discounts. They only discount a few useless products that are meant to give SnappFood a showy appearance,Negative

The pizza dough was very doughy and soft,Positive

How many hours does it take to cook 4 pieces of bread?! 2 hours?!,Negative

I really liked that it arrived relatively quickly. I just think it would be better to put the cheese and mushrooms next to the steak rather than pouring them on it,Positive
It was very bad. The sauces were so thin and watery. There was a lot of sauce in the sandwich itself so that the sauces overflowed from the sandwich. The chicken fillet was also spicy and peppery,Negative

It was good. Rice was a bit mushy and the stew was fatty but overall it was good,Positive
"Considering the long distance, the food arrived quickly. There were only 6 pieces of sour chicken and the extra patty was a short skewer.

"The size of the shrimp suffices as an appetizer, not a main dish. The price of the shrimp is too high relative to the portion you send",Negative
"I can't believe I got this food from Pasta Factory. I have been a customer there for 8 years and I have never eaten such bad food from them. The food was very cold. The ravioli was like a very thin soup, not like pasta. The vegetable sandwich was very low-quality and its taste was not as usual.",Negative
Delicious and high-quality as always. Thank you to the cook and the staff.,Positive
The tuna's expiry date was near.,Negative
"The sweets were fresh and good, but instead of 25 pieces they were 10 regular pieces. Adjust the quantity correctly because everyone orders based on the quantity and they will be embarrassed in front of their guest.",Negative
"We ordered a family pizza and in my opinion, when a pizza is called family, it means it should satisfy at least 3 people, but as we were two, we did not get enough. At the very least, write ""medium pizza"" on the menu, not family.",Negative

The kebab was very low-quality.,Negative
Great.. always stay this good,Positive
"It is customary to use chicken fillet for Strips, not the breast itself. Burgurator is the first fast food restaurant I have seen that make strips from sliced chicken breasts. There is no problem with that, but customers must know that Burgator strips are a bit drier than others. It is very crispy, but a bit more than necessary and it was too oily. It is not expected from Burgatory that its oil smells.",Positive
Three ice creams were ordered and the price of three ice creams was paid while only two ice creams were delivered.,Negative

I received it very late, but still thank you for the excellent taste of the mini-pizzas. Waiting is worth it.",Positive
"The price-to-size ratio is not good. Altogether, it was not tasty. One of them was also burnt. I am not satisfied.",Negative
"The quality was good, but the size was too small, you can order a pizza for two people for the same price.",Negative
"Hello, the Gheymeh had the smell of plastic. Maybe the inappropriate container is the reason for it. The Fesenjan was too sour.",Negative
"The quality of the Cranberry Chicken salad was too poor, it was kept in the fridge so long that its ingredients are rotten. I did not expect it from Sib. It was inedible. I am very sorry.",Negative
"This is the first time that I order from here, it was fresh and delicious, and it also arrived fast. Thank you for your good quality.",Positive

"This is the second time I order yogurt from this store and there's a problem. This time I ordered two yogurts. One of them was good, but the other one has a crack in the corner. It's ridiculous.",Negative
The yogurt that was sent for free was not good quality.,Negative
"It was very good and the packaging was very chic and good. But why is the malt drink that costs 4500, you sell for 5500????",Positive
"We are an organization. We need to give the invoices to our manager. On the invoice that the restaurant gives, the delivery fee is zero. While we have paid 2000 tomans for the delivery. Please fix this inconsistency.",Negative

It was good but very sweet. I hope it was not just sugar,Positive
"Hello, this is the first time I order food from Snapp Food. It's great that everything is at hand, but I hope Snapp Food reaches this stage of progress and sends experts to test the restaurants that work with it!!! Oh my God, I can't believe it. Is there such a thing? Can Dizil be so bad taste? It didn't taste at all; it didn't even have anything defined as a flavor, It tasted like hospital food. I mean, if they had sent us a piece of cheese with Sangak, it would have tasted better. It arrived very quickly, the packaging, and the service were excellent, but the food strangely had no taste!! They threw chickpeas, potatoes, and meat into the water and brought it to our house!!! To this extent!!!!! It's a pity to call this food Dizil! Even if they bring it for free, I will not eat it",Negative
"Very good, both the dish and the food. I am really satisfied",Positive
We were very dissatisfied because the price of the food was very high compared to its volume and quality. The food was also cold.,Negative
"First, the restaurant was very low quality. They did not send Ghormeh Sabzi and instead sent Gheymeh. They forgot the drink. Then, when they came to exchange the food, there was Gheymeh at the bottom of the Ghormeh Sabzi container. They did not have meat in Ghormeh Sabzi. They put the meat from Gheymeh in it.

The potatoes are getting very doughy lately. Unfortunately.,Negative
"Everything was great, especially the tomatoes and strawberries. God bless you",Positive
"The ratio of the price to the volume of the salad was very low. Unfortunately, the Greek salad smelled stale. It is strange for a restaurant like Perprook but in my opinion all restaurants reduce the quality of food in Ramadan, especially in the afternoon, which is not good and should not continue. In any case, when the supervision goes down, the quality goes down as well. Anyway, good luck.",Negative
"It was very stale, you should review it.",Negative
Thank you very much. The packing was beautiful.,Positive
The restaurant's rolls and cream puffs are the best. The cream is light and very delicious. Thank you very much.,Positive
Generally it is good and acceptable.,Positive
The quality of the food and potatoes have gone down noticeably. I have been a customer of yours for 2 years. The fries were burnt and I threw them away. Pizza was not cooked well either. It is a pity that such a good restaurant loses its quality. I am saying this for your own good.,Negative

Why does delivering one kilo of eggplant take an hour and twenty minutes?,Negative
The kebab was delicious but the food was overall cold and the rice was messy in the container. The spicy rice was not good at all but the kebab by itself,Positive

"The dough was extremely thin and the pizza had soggy water on the inside, which was probably because the mushrooms should have been drained of their water beforehand so that water would not accumulate in the middle of the pizza",Negative
The Alpuro pizza was disgusting. The quality was very low. It seemed like you were eating bread with cheese. The pizza was all wrinkled when it got to me. You are better off eating cheese and bread,Negative

With each order; price increases and quality decreases. Mushroom sauce is completely eliminated from the food. Even the size of the burger and its ingredients has been greatly reduced. While it wasn't like this before. Please think of increasing the quality instead of reaching the box and the paper around the burger,Negative
The delivery guy arrived talking on the phone and went away while talking. He didn't even answer my and my son's greetings. It was a very rude behavior,Negative

"""Despite the very close distance, the delivery arrived very late and the food had also become cold. Although Golha Pizza is well-known and the quality of their food is usually good, there were pieces of chicken cartilage in the steak pizza and the pieces of meat were hard and tasted like stew.

"The food was good, but the delay was too long.",Negative

The hotdog was completely raw...it hadn't even been heated up a little...and it was cold...I absolutely do not suggest anyone order hotdogs from this restaurant. It was really bad,Negative

"Excellent, thank you to the nice young gentleman who manages the restaurant",Positive
"We usually order this dish and it's always been great. However, we ordered it a few times when it was on sale and the quality was very low. Firstly, the portion was much smaller than usual, and the fries were few and had been reheated several times, and the vegetables and mushrooms were very tasteless",Negative
There were so many smarties and snacks on it that we put it in the freezer and didn't eat it so we could taste the ice cream. The saffron ice cream was very different from the Nemat ice cream that we've eaten all over Iran and it wasn't from Nemat,Negative

"Not very full, but delicious",Positive
"In the children's menu (Happy Land), a doll was also mentioned, which unfortunately was not sent (of course, after following up, it was removed from the menu and they announced that our doll was finished). You know better that when it comes to children, the issue is completely different because persuading two three-year-old children who are waiting for a Happy Meal with dolls about the absence of dolls is difficult. Before sending, it should have been reported to the customer and he or she could make a decision, or possibly have an order from another restaurant.",Negative
The breads were mostly doughy and thick.,Negative
The price of potatoes with mushroom sauce is very high compared to its price:,Positive
"The quality of the chicken was very bad, it was greasy and old and it tasted bad, the chicken was frozen",Positive

"We always order Shuleh Soup, and it was very good. However, it was not as good as before tonight. It was as if it had become watery. It was very thin and its overall quality was different from previous times",Negative
The seller removed the price of the product on the oil and tore the paper with his hand! Why should they do this? The product bought at the previous fixed rate and the profit has been calculated should not be calculated at their new purchase rate. This act has no justification,Negative

Its quality was very low,Negative
"Nivea cream was priced higher than other supermarkets, which is offered at a lower price in most Snapp Food supermarkets. This inconsistency is unwarranted in my opinion and I am not satisfied with this item at all",Negative
"I received my orders completely hot and fresh. The taste of freshness in the used ingredients was completely felt. Of course, quality processed cheese was not used in hot dog sandwiches. The potato was very tasty, well-seasoned and fresh and hot. The baguette used in the chicken sandwich was not fresh. The amount of sauce the restaurant uses was not enough in the sandwich. The number of sauces and forks really satisfied me. Overall, I was very satisfied. The food arrived earlier than expected. Considering Bayern Munich's team win, the food was very, very, very satisfying. Good luck.",Positive
A path that takes 20 minutes on foot took 2 hours!!!,Negative

The 250 ml Fanta glass bottle was all regular soda, but they sent it at the price of a glass bottle, i.e. they sent a 2-toman soda but charged 2200 for each 200.

Also it's better to have family-sized soda in the menu if you have a delivery service since it's more economical for families and they don't have to order soda from stores",Positive

"Fast delivery, great service from the delivery guy, good packaging, thank you",Positive
It couldn't get any worse,Negative

The pizza ingredients were very few. It was like we just ate bread and cheese. Chicken pizza includes 2 chopped olives. A sliced mushroom. Maybe 2 thinly sliced chicken fillets. Cheese and bread.. It didn't even have oregano.,Negative
The fried fillet was not chicken fillet at all. It was small pieces of chicken and completely low quality,Negative
"Unfortunately, due to improper transportation, the entire appearance of the pizza was ruined",Negative

The bread was very dry. One sauce is not enough for this dry sandwich,Negative
The food was normal and good. The courier was very nice,Positive

It was very very delicious and I received it quickly,Positive
"The size was not for 2, and the quality of the food is not good at all. It also tastes very bad, it was bad in every way",Negative

I had asked them to put 1 piece of pineapple and 1 piece of strawberry for testing so that if I liked it, I would order it. In addition to putting these items, they also put a quantity of their flavored nuts for me to test, which was very delicious. I became your regular customer",Positive
"The bread was fresh, but a little dry",Positive
"This supermarket is really awful, and it takes more than an hour to bring a simple item, while the distance to our house is 10 minutes. I will not buy anything from here because this was the second time there was a delay. Last time it took exactly 2 hours, and this time it took 1 hour and 15 minutes",Negative
"It arrived on time, the food was warm, the packaging was good, the materials were of good quality and tasty, only it had too much fenugreek, which I don't like much in Ghormeh Sabzi, and I have one suggestion, which is to put mini Tahchin, because the amount was too much for me",Positive

"It was great, thank you for your amazing diversity",Positive
The amount of potato sauce was very little,Negative
"As always, it was fresh and tasty. Thank you",Positive
"The taste of the fried chicken was unique and excellent. The chicken was fried in small pieces, which made the taste of the food better. It is a bit too much for one person. I suggest that the volume and price of the food be adjusted accordingly. Of course, this is a matter of taste, and I don't eat much. The food was very hot, and the behavior of the restaurant courier was good.",Positive
"Food quality was good, the price was reasonable. But I wonder why they used such a large package for a single serving? All the pickles and cabbage were mixed with the rice. I don't like pickles, what should I do with the food?",Negative
The portion size was very small …,Negative
"The pizza was not worth the price and they didn't understand the concept of roast beef. The fried mushrooms were bad, they were very small and they put them in the box hot, so they became like dough and tasteless.",Negative

"It was very sweet, so much so that it made you feel sick after eating a little, and it was also a little stale.",Negative
"They forgot the dental biscuits. They are not expensive and they are not important. But when you are shopping in a supermarket, it is important to have each item separately. If they forget one of the four items, it's a hassle.",Negative

The food I received was completely cold.,Negative

"1- We ordered a cake and they sent a completely different cake, which was a mistake. 2- The cake was damaged and it looked like it had been melted and then put back in the refrigerator. 3- The cake was of poor quality, so I will not buy from them again and I do not recommend them. I am really surprised that they lose customers so easily, when they could just meet the customer's request and keep them! And finally, Snapp Food is also discrediting itself with these invalid stars. We finally understood the meaning of 4 stars!!!!!!",Negative
It was both cold and stale and extremely tasteless and low quality.,Negative

"I was a fan of Pepperwok pizzas and their very delicious sauces in their other branch a few years ago, but this was the first time I ordered from this branch (Gheitari).

And pays attention to the details exactly 1-The delivered food was completely warm and ready to eat. 2-The food was grilled well. 3-The ingredients were fresh and good. 4-The volume was excellent, excellent, excellent. 5-Even the size of tomatoes and the hotness of peppers were considered. Maybe it was luck, but anyway I really enjoyed it. 6- Tea and herbal tea were really appropriate and creative. I predict that with this method, your restaurant will gain an unprecedented reputation not only in this region but soon in the whole province of Tehran.",Positive

Very greasy. Uselessly greasy.,Negative
Good and delicious.. I'm crazy about dip,Positive
"There was one bad point, and that was that the potatoes were not fried completely, they were crushed and stuck to the cardboard, and we had to fry them again ourselves.

"I ordered Kent 4 cigarettes, but unfortunately I received Kent 1",Negative
"Greetings, the price of food in comparison to its volume and quality is very expensive. And the sandwich that was sent is just like a normal, light snack, for which it is unfair to pay around 20,000 Tomans. Thank you.",Negative
It was very bad. The whole volume of pizza is bread.,Negative

Caesar salad that was just lettuce,Negative
Low quality fruit despite their high price,Negative
It had little cream and was more of an ice cream smoothie,Negative

"At first I thought there would be a delivery fee. Okay, it's not good. But then the packaging was great, even until the moment of delivery it was kept warm inside the quality container, the quality was also great.

The omelet was delivered without bread or any garnish. The croissant was small and without fruit. How can food be served like that in a cafe?! Why did you charge so much for the croissant and omelet?!?,Negative
Very fresh and delicious.,Positive
"Compared to the salad that I ate in the dining room, it was bad. The sauce container is very unsuitable.",Negative

The Bakhtiari was also more like regular chicken and had only three small pieces of meat and all in all, it was really ordinary and not tasty and we had to eat it with orange juice and pickles. Unfortunately, all in all, we were not satisfied. The only positive point of the order was the rice which tasted good. Unfortunately, I doubt we'll order food from this restaurant anymore",Negative

The taste of the Nostalgic Pizza was very bad and the food was stale by the time it arrived,Negative
"The food was very bad. The french fries were stale and completely cold. The chicken also seemed to have been fried two days ago and that too was completely cold.

"In general, it is our favorite fast food in the area! We like the delicious sauce in the pizza and its freshness!",Positive
The sandwich was delicious but small,Positive
"Cheese pizza was like a dough with some low-quality cheese on it. It is not a bad idea to be generous and at least put a thicker and better quality cheese. The pepperoni pizza also had very little cheese and low-quality sausage, but it was okay. The pasta salad was fresh and ordinary",Negative
Excellent quality and quantity but it arrived very late and cold,Negative
"The food was very, very cold. The potatoes were stale and old.",Negative
"The food was extremely cold, the worst of all was that there was raw egg white between the Greek pizza, it was really bad",Negative
"It was great. If only you sold them individually instead of selling them per kilogram, it would be easier to buy them",Positive
"The potatoes were very delicious… The sandwich was also delicious but it was very heavy so that my lunch and dinner became one …1 or 2 minutes remained until the food was ready to be dispatched and the courier stood on the way for a quarter of an hour. I don’t know what they were doing that I called them to complain, made excuses and finally gave me the food …",Negative
I received my order very quickly. Thank you very much,Positive
"They emptied sugar into the Halim, maybe some do not like sugar, they also didn’t put yogurt into the soup, it is assumed that sugar or yogurt should be sent in a separate small container so that anyone who wants to can add it, Halim came out as very thin and short strands, the meat was not elastic",Negative
"It was excellent, exceptional in all of Tehran",Positive
The order was delivered very fast and on time.,Positive
"To find a weakness, you have to give me a reward. Thanks",Positive
"It's great, the price and the taste of the pizza is good. The sandwiches also had a good and unique taste. And more importantly, their manners and conduct with the couriers are great",Positive
"The fish was totally burned at its edges, I do not know how they could send it like that. The rice wasn't bad, nothing to write home about. I do not think I will be ordering from here anymore",Negative
Half of the pizza was burned at its edges,Negative
"The quality of the meat used was very low, considering the price of the food, the quality should have been better, but unfortunately, the meat only smelled of fat. The cheddar sauce was also spread around so badly that it was more of a feature of the plate than the food. Also, the courier did not have any change and had to go get some from the restaurant which wasted my time",Negative
"The oil used had a very bad taste, it was not good at all and it arrived very late",Negative
"The taste of the sweets was good. In the specifications, it was mentioned that between 12 to 14 pieces would be 1 kg, but our package contained 10 pieces. Although, we are staying optimistic",Positive
"You look at it for yourself. I ordered Damداران cheese, they charged me for the cheese, but instead, they gave me Damداران milk with a price that was cheaper than the cheese. Judge for yourself!!!!",Negative

"Honestly, they had cut this cake for 6 to 8 people, but it was suited for 5 people. We were 10 people and everyone got a very small piece, to the point that it was disappointing. Considering that I buy cakes from the best confectioneries with the same price and it would be enough for 10 people, the taste was good, maybe because it was so little, we thought it was delicious. I hope this confectionery undergoes some changes, thanks",Negative
"The Bakhtiari was so raw that it felt like I was eating liver, the chicken was burnt and uncooked",Negative
"The order was delivered with a very long delay. I think they had forgotten to send it to me!!!!. When it arrived, it was a disappointment. It was extremely dry and stale",Negative
"The amount of rice was halved compared to before and it was very little, also Snapp Food, if for every order, the courier is not supposed to bring the food upstairs, like they have started doing, what is the point of ordering from a restaurant around the corner? We might as well go ourselves and collect it!",Negative
"The food was cold and the pizza dough was not cooked well and was raw. Also the toppings on the pizza were very little and it was just cheese. Overall, the pizza didn't have any excitement in the taste",Negative
Half of the Americano coffee had spilled out so much that the cup was warped and not usable,Negative
"The food quality was excellent but the food prices were high and the tax cost was really useless, please display the final price of food on the menu",Negative

"The pizza was very ordinary and not worth its price, I regret it",Negative
"I wonder why the food gets messed up whenever we order from this place, we didn't see any minced meat or lasagna sheets in the lasagna, nothing at all just cheese and that's it, really disappointing",Negative
"Hello and good day, when you order cold food please schedule your time properly so that neither the customer nor the courier faces any problems",Positive

It was very delicious but the price is too low compared to its contents,Negative
Inconsistency in the ordered and received brands,Negative
"Honestly, selling a very small piece of toast with weak ingredients as breakfast at this price is not right at all... I will definitely not be ordering again...",Negative
"Hello, I have ordered this food four or five times now and every time I have given it 5 out of 5 stars because it has been really great. However, this time it was really awful, right from the start the plastic food container and the paper box smelled like raw meat and the sandwich itself was really smelly in some parts so that I had to throw away almost 2/3 of the food... I hope you look into this because it used to be good quality food",Negative

The quality was very high and very very delicious,Positive
It was not worth its price at all,Negative
Thank you very much. The food was great and arrived on time,Positive
"This was the first time I wanted to buy from this restaurant. I read the comments, both positive and negative. Tonight I realized that there is a reason why some brands don’t become well-known. Either they do their job correctly right from the beginning, or they try to get their customers’ feedback and improve their weak points. Unfortunately, the weak points that people have mentioned and I read since this restaurant opened are still there. The 3-piece spicy chicken was not spicy at all. The chicken was very greasy and oily. But worst of all was the packaging. It was in a cardboard box with no grease paper or hygienic cover. The cardboard box was greasy all over like a pita bread and it had gotten mixed with the chicken. The delivery boy was very polite, the delivery was very fast, the food was hot, and the French fries were fresh and crispy",Negative
Excellent and good. Very fast. Thank you,Positive
"The rice was completely Indian style, the quality of the koobideh and ghormeh sabzi was very bad",Negative
"We were satisfied. Only the can of tomato paste had dents and had caved in a little. In the comments, we had emphasized that the can should be fully intact",Positive
"In my opinion, the food was cold and low-quality",Negative
"The pizza was good, but considering the high price of the Alfredo cheese fries, the portion was very small and not worth it at all",Negative
"I bought the same thing from you a few days ago and it was excellent, but tonight it was not that good. Please maintain your quality. I hope from now on it will always be the way it was before. Thank you",Positive
"Inside one kilo of zoolbia and bamieh, there were about 3/4 of a box of bamieh and just a few zoolbia",Negative
Excellent. I would just like to say thank you,Positive
"The fabric softener was broken, the cologne had a totally different scent and brand, and instead of a KitKat, you sent me a His chocolate bar. I am truly disappointed that they don’t even know how to take their time with someone who makes a 300-toman purchase or show them some respect",Negative
"This was the second time I placed an order. The quality was excellent as before, and the preparation was also very fast",Positive
"The Nutella cheesecake was average and tasted fairly good, but the New York cheesecake was very bad; it was a dry piece of cake with just a hint of cheese, didn’t even taste like cake. It was like eating a stale piece of bread",Negative
"Hi, this has happened several times now. The delivery guy calls and tells me to come downstairs to get my order and doesn’t bring it to the door of my unit. When I tell him to, he says it’s not his job to go to the door",Negative
"The quality of the food was very good, but the delivery was very late",Positive
"In my opinion, they need to work on the flavor and spices of the roast beef. The pizza cheese flavor was more noticeable than the meat’s flavor. The meat was overcooked. It would be better if it was juicier",Positive
The delivery time was too long and the food was delivered cold,Negative
"After an hour and a half, it was delivered completely cold with stale bread and very low-quality ingredients. Without a doubt, this sirloin steak from Baroozh was the worst meal I ordered from SnappFood in 2018. It was a disaster",Negative

"Hello and thank you for your hard work, firstly the sent ice cream cake was different from its picture and secondly it was completely frozen so that we could hardly cut a piece of it with a knife, the fruits on it were also completely frozen and hard.",Negative
Two hours delay. Order at 1:15 PM. Delivery at 3:15 PM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Negative
"Compared to the price, the quality was good, but for the first order from this restaurant it was stated that they would give a free drink...but they didn't.",Negative

"Hello, thank you so much. The food arrived very quickly and the quality was really good. Its volume was really big and exactly similar to the picture. Thank you, dear staff of Piano",Positive
"The chocolate cream cake was only in a cellophane and a paper sole which was a little crushed during delivery and the possibility of keeping it at home was naturally reduced and that in apple pie if the dried fruit itself is not used at least jam is used, use apple jam. This was more like carrot jam, but let's forget about the apple base, the other two cakes were good. I didn't expect a lot of walnuts and considering the advertising use of the dialect of some places, walnuts were used and it felt completely and reminded me of good flavors. If I hadn't eaten a more delicious cake anywhere in my life, I would definitely give it a 5 out of 5 and thank you for your good app",Positive
I was not dissatisfied. My hand touched it :) Thank you,Positive
"Excellent. I have been a customer of Eslami Chelo Kababi for two years and all the food is of very good quality and even when we have guests, I order food from Eslami Chelo Kababi. Amazing quality and very tasty. Thanks to the staff of Eslami Chelo Kababi and also Snapp Food",Positive

The volume of food was really high but it didn't have any specific taste,Negative
They do not pay attention to the descriptions,Negative

"In the description I insisted on sending me a fresh cake and if it is not fresh send another model that is fresh. But unfortunately, our request was not valued at all. What is the meaning of a cake that has frozen bananas? It is like the cake was made last week and put in the freezer and frozen. It was very old and stale. I am very unhappy and sad",Negative
"The chocolate snickers was very old, when I opened it it was clear that it was old and hadn't been sold for a long time. I really wasted my money",Negative
The chocolate roll was excellent! It was very soft and the cream was light,Positive
"Yesterday I ordered some boxes of zoolbia bamieh both for myself and for my colleagues, the quality of the bamieh was low. It was stale and old, my reputation was ruined in front of my colleagues. They ordered them from this confectionery under my account. I had ordered papa cake and pastry before and the quality was good, but the quality of the zoolbia bamieh was really low",Negative
The food was cold and inedible,Negative
"I think if the food containers or their bags have a logo or are prettier, it would be better. The roast beef was excellent but the hamburger didn't taste good",Positive
A different bread was used. The previous one was better,Negative
"It was good, the chicken tasted good, only the rice smelled a bit, but overall it was good",Positive

Very very average and even worse than supermarket cold sandwiches,Negative
"The food delivery time was one hour and fifteen minutes even after two follow-ups and begging!! Food was cold! If our comments are not censored, such restaurants will not rise! Most of the time an apology cannot fix anything, respecting the customer is a good thing, work on it...",Negative

"It was excellent, the burger bread model was attractive",Positive
"It was good, only the chicken was a bit hard",Positive
The vitamin container was not suitable and half of the order was spilled,Negative
"Hello, thank you for your good service, unlike always, the courier did not have a card reader device, and I had to call the fast food and get the card number",Negative
"The quality of the products sent was good, but the fruits and vegetables were very expensive",Negative
Chicken pieces were not cooked well and the pasta sauce was too watery. This wasn't the usual Guardino pasta we used to have,Negative
I think it was great. It was not too greasy or stale like some other places. It also had enough meat. The 40-minute cooking time is also good,Positive
The fried salmon did not have a special taste (was totally bland),Negative
"Hi, the food was completely cold and the chicken was completely uncooked to such an extent that it caused a stomachache and nausea",Negative
The shape of the cake we received was completely ruined. What's the point of a birthday cake that looks like nothing? The whole cake was destroyed,Negative
The food was very tasty and arrived very quickly,Positive
"I don't know if it was due to bad packaging or Snapp's negligence or perhaps both, but all the faloodeh juice spilled into the plastic. We couldn't taste it at all. The ice cream was also frozen. The banana ice pack was good",Negative
"A very ordinary pizza. The thickness of the bread made it doughy. The cheese used was very greasy. The ingredients were not well distributed. It had only three slices of meat on it, and most of the meat was burnt",Negative
The chicken rice was not salty enough and it seemed the chicken was not fresh,Negative
"In terms of volume and size, it was very good, but in terms of quality, not at all. It was quite obvious that the sandwich had not been made fresh. The bread was stale, and the chips inside the sandwich had become completely soggy. I do not recommend this sandwich",Negative

High quality; thank you for attention to detail,Positive
"The food was good; the order was delivered on time. Overall, very good",Positive

"It was excellent, extraordinary. Warm and fresh",Positive
The quality was poor. A few pieces of pizza and were missing from the order,Negative
The stew was not fresh and had frothed from reheating. The mast-o-khiar was not the usual quality and had declined. The basil was completely missing. I was not at all satisfied with this. I hope the quality of this restaurant does not decline,Negative
Great deliveryman good food,Positive
This time some of the breads were doughy,Negative
The sandwich was cold and its bread was dry and full of pickles... Altogether the price did not match the quality,Negative

"One of the best pizzas I've ever had and of course the most expensive. Its quality is really good and it arrived warm, thank you",Positive
"The food was generally cold and with inappropriate pizza cheese. Overall, it was not satisfactory at all",Negative
"The taste of the food was really great, but the amount of food relative to its price was very small. I think if the amount changes a little and it also has a different design, it will have more impact on customer satisfaction and repeat orders",Positive
"The deliveryman said that I should come to the door to receive the food and I expected much more from Sib360 because I had ordered from another branch of yours and it was very good. Not only was the quality low, the pepperoni was not fresh at all",Negative

The deliveryman and the store's speed were excellent,Positive
One of the ordered items was missing and the deliveryman brought it again,Negative
Extremely delicious and healthy. Thanks,Positive
The packaging of bread and onions was inappropriate. It also did not have a spoon and a fork,Negative
"Its name is big, but it was small",Negative
"It was very bad... The chicken was completely tasteless and the onions had sweetened the food. It also took 1 hour and 20 minutes for delivery, which is really unfortunate...",Negative
"I wrote in the description that it should be chocolatey. Not only was it not chocolatey, it had pastries that I did not like. And it was stale. Besides, it was not half a kilo. I weighed it on a scale and it was 380 grams, which shows the utmost neglect of customer trust. I will not buy again. The only good part was the deliveryman's good behavior",Negative
It arrived on time and tasted good. Overall it was satisfying but expensive,Positive
The box of pastries seemed to have been tossed around. The powdered sugar on top of the napoleon pastries had spilled into the box.,Negative

"Unfortunately, they brought us stale and old cake",Negative
It tasted excellent. I just wish there were some potatoes on the side. The serving size was small,Positive
"The chicken with barberry rice was definitely a few days old. It tasted stale, was tough and unchewable, and had a layer of dried chicken on top. It was truly the worst chicken I've ever seen. The kebab was also not worth the price",Negative
The price of the pizza is too high relative to its size,Negative
Wooooow what a delicious cake and what a friendly delivery guy. I am so grateful to you,Positive

Danish pastry was not fresh and was cooked at least one to two days ago,Negative
"I buy several times from KFC ... really has a great taste, fresh chicken, great recipe, and amazing service speed. In my opinion, this is the best fried chicken in Iran and can not be beaten. I recommend to try it at least once",Positive
"Bahamas is excellent. I have tried almost all of its sandwiches and the taste of all is excellent, but they do not really differ much in taste. A little variety would be good, because its price is not cheap.",Positive
"Food was very, very cold and stale when it arrived",Negative
It was good as it was defined,Positive
"They sent the same things that I wanted. Just the bleach was placed badly in the plastic, which caused it to spill inside the plastic. Perhaps the respectable Snapp Express had been a little careless, but I was satisfied overall. Thank you",Positive
The food was completely cold and the food packaging was disorganized and the foil on the food was torn,Negative
"Food is good, but their delivery never comes on time. I buy a lot from them, but their delivery time is really inappropriate and needs the patience of Ayub",Negative

"Food arrived very late and as always, it was not fresh and from the two cans of soda that I ordered, one was delivered to me. Please be more careful in your deliveries",Negative

The rice tasted raw. The chicken also tasted bad. It was a disaster overall.,Negative
"Shila was only good a few years ago when it first opened. Now it's gotten to the point where every time I order from Shila, I only regret it, and then a few months later I check again to see if maybe it's gotten better and the negative comments have been answered and they've improved, but I still see that it's gotten even worse than before. It's a shame.",Negative
"The pizza was really delicious, and thank you for setting the cheese dip aside from the potatoes. That was really professional.",Positive
It was very good relative to the price.,Positive
Chicken ham was not included.,Negative
"Good taste and flavor, excellent quality, excellent packaging, excellent volume of food and side dishes. It's just that I don't think this was a blade kebab, it was a koobideh that you pan-fried. Also, despite being close to the restaurant and the weather being warm, the food arrived lukewarm.",Negative
"I called the restaurant and asked for sauce, but unfortunately, they didn't send it.",Negative
The steak sandwich was completely burnt and black! You really shouldn't use such ingredients in a sandwich.,Negative

"Excellent. The corn was so delicious that I wish I had ordered the large size. The milkshake was so good that I had it after the corn and got a stomach ache :))), The date milk was very delicious. Everything was really excellent and delicious. The packaging was great, and nothing had spilled, so thanks to the delivery guy, too. God bless your business.",Positive
Chicken fillets were very salty and tasteless. They usually make it salty because the chicken is old and smells bad.,Negative
A very ordinary meal. You could reduce the large portion size a little and instead improve the quality. All that rice with no meat or even soy reduced the quality of the food.,Negative
"The delivery was fast and on time, the food was delicious, and the side dishes were appropriate. I just wish they would also include a spoon and fork with the food.",Positive
The contents of the black pepper spilled into the bag and made the rest of the items dirty. This is the second time this has happened!!!,Negative
"Unfortunately, recently, items that are finished aren't deactivated on the menu page. This causes the customer, who has waited a while for the food, to have to choose something else, even from another restaurant. The haleem really tasted like white sauce without butter, not haleem or even wheat soup. The oil that should be from butter, animal fat, and meat has been completely replaced with vegetable oil. The aash wasn't bad. I hope they pay a little more attention to the quality. Also, whoever buys food definitely values their money, time, and health.",Negative

"The pizza was extremely low quality. The pizza ingredients had no variety, just some chopped cheap sausage and cheese. There are much better choices for 50 thousand Tomans.

"I accidentally clicked the ""Not Satisfied"" option. Could anyone not be satisfied with Neshat; it's excellent as always",Positive
"When an order is delivered in such a terrible manner, I have nothing to say. I informed Snapp Food with a photo the second it was delivered.

"The quality of the pizza has dropped a lot compared to before. It was almost just plain bread and had very little steak and mushrooms. The delivery guy was not friendly and because of other orders they had, they didn't even deliver the food properly and left it in the elevator and sent it. And worst of all, due to improper packaging the sauce spilled inside the bag and we didn't have any garlic sauce to use and the pizza itself was not inside the box properly and was completely broken in the middle. This level of poor quality in product and delivery service is not at all appealing for a well-known brand like Barooj and it made me pay more attention when choosing a restaurant the next time",Negative

Really, why?",Negative
The Nutella dessert didn't have any Nutella at all,Negative

"You guys really take all this money for food, both the volume has been reduced and the quality has dropped severely. Now, if you are a well-known brand, you should not just give anything to the people instead of pizza…. In fact, the owner of Parپروک does not allow himself to read and respond to negative comments and criticisms. Not everything is money and income at any cost, this is disrespect to the customer. I am sorry for the management of this fast food restaurant. By the way, the distance between us is exactly 150 to 200 meters, so why should you take  3,000 tomans for the delivery fee????!!!!! I hope SnappFood at least displays my criticism and does not censor it.",Negative

"The fried egg in the German breakfast wasn't cooked. I don't mind a runny yolk, but this was raw egg and even some part of the egg white was raw.

The tomato demi-glace was also a disaster, and there was no sign of tomato; it was just potatoes and a bit of meat. I wish they had at least informed me that this dish would be removed from the menu due to the increase in tomato prices during this season. It's really shameful.",Negative

"The quality and quantity of the chicken and eggplant Tahchin were very good and perfect, it was very hot and reached me quickly (thanks to Snapp Express), the packaging was very good and suitable and the Tahchin did not fall apart or get damaged, it was obvious that it was freshly made and not from the leftover rice and it was completely fresh, it even smells a lot of saffron and it is obvious that a lot of attention has been paid to it, the only complaint I have is about the Shirazi salad which in my opinion was not of a suitable price in terms of quantity and quality, I think it should be bigger and when lemon juice is added to the salad, it becomes a little loose and the texture of the salad is ruined, of course I ordered late at night and this problem probably does not exist in noon orders and I think something should be done for night orders",Positive

"The delivery person asked me to receive the order at the apartment door. The peppers fell from the plastic bag into the hallway!!! The hand soap was sent without a pump lid!!! Such small-scale profiteering and driving away customers is a sign of poor business sense. Ordering from a supermarket online should be for convenience, not for added hassles. I am not likely to order from this store again.",Negative

"I am an old customer of Zoofood and also this restaurant. Because of the previous follow-ups, the restaurant did a great job last time, but this time it made up for it and the food was bad. The food was cold that the cheese was melted on it. The management of this restaurant should think about the issue of delivering cold food to the people because this was the critique of many. As always, the side dishes are also put less and they don't pay attention to what the person has requested in the description (for example, what color sauce they wanted and what flavor of Delester). In terms of quantity, it is not worth it even compared to half the price offered, let alone this price. I hope it is followed up. Thank you, dear Zoofood",Negative
"Hi. If you are going to deliver a cheeseburger in an hour, tell us so that we don't order because really, a hungry person can only last for half an hour at most. Again, the quality was not that good and you always say that it will get better and you will make up for it. I understand that it was Friday and you can't satisfy everyone's opinions, but every time I wait for this time to say that Shila has attracted my attention, but it doesn't",Negative
The quality was very bad,Negative
"It adds the tax price, while in comparison with other items, the price is high enough, and for a distance of 200 meters, it receives a delivery fee of 1500 Tomans, so a 19,000-Toman order becomes a 23,500-Toman order",Negative

"I'm really sorry for this choice, Ghoreh Bademjan stew 63 thousand and Gheymeh 48 thousand tomans, but the taste and quality were really worth 10 thousand tomans. I dare say ordinary restaurants that offer rice and stew at a price of 20 to 25 are sometimes much, much better than Honey Parsa are, In total, both stews had 4 pieces of meat",Negative
The burger meat had no quality at all and was full of cartilage inside,Negative

On the other hand, the rider's behavior was not respectful at all and they didn't even say hello and just delivered the food like someone who owes them and left.",Negative

"I think this is the fifth time that I ordered this salad. The quality has dropped dramatically due to the taste of the salad sauce.

The design is completely disorganized... Please take care of it",Negative

"You brought Mini Pizza!!! It wasn't 24 cm, I measured it, it was 20 cm. Say mini pizza so that one knows what to expect",Negative
"The delivery was quick and warm. Of course, there was no spoon with the food. The volume of food was more than the price, but I wish that instead of a combination of Iranian and Indian rice, they would only serve Iranian rice but in a smaller volume. I have the same opinion about the quality of minced meat. I wish it was single-skewer but the percentage of meat was higher",Positive

It was great and wonderful in every way,Positive

"I said that I did not feel like giving any feedback this time but I thought to myself that it may be unfair. First, I ordered at 10:52 and the food arrived at 11:15, and I don't believe why some people wrote that it arrived late the food was cold. Of course, I live in west Darya (Shakufan). Secondly, what a light, tasty, and lovable food! Previously, I had given feedback on the pizza and have ordered this pizza several times, today it seemed to me that the toppings were more and while I was eating the pizza I was thinking whether they would give me the pizza dough recipe because I love cooking. However, this pizza may not be that popular in Italy, but I should say that I am Iranian and I loved it. The chips that I ordered were like the Mexican tortilla but they were excellent and the way the ingredients were arranged was very good, one layer of chips, one layer of curry-flavored sauce with a little spiciness, and another layer of chips, then light cheese (low-fat maybe, or maybe I am wrong). In short, although I do not usually connect with chain brands, I can approve of these two foods from this brand",Positive

They did not pay attention to the expiration date. I want to return it but I do not know how! The courier delivered and left, and we after delivery we found out that the product is about to expire.

"I have been a customer of Snapp food for a long time and I am very satisfied with some restaurants and the management of Snapp food but for this order sandwich, most of it was mashed potatoes, it also had a little chicken, the potatoes were also doughy due to improper packaging and it was as if a 2-year-old child had cut the potatoes and worst of all, for 1 sandwich and a potato, only 1 single-serving ketchup was placed, there was no news of fork and straw, overall I thought I would have a better meal but the taste was not good at all, the price was high and I did not expect it at all. But thanks for the kind Snapp food",Negative

"This was the second time that the delay was more than an hour, I will not order again",Negative
"Thank you, it was very neatly packed, it arrived on time, good quality",Positive

The food arrived in my hand like ice,Negative
"It took less than twenty minutes to deliver! And they fully cooperated on the additional points, which itself makes you remember a good feeling and memory from a simple order.

Full marks. Good luck.",Positive
The number of candles they brought was few! Now I have to have my thirty-third birthday party as my third birthday,Negative

We were surprised, does each serving of their food contain half a kilo of rice?! We called the restaurant to ask. Unfortunately, the lady who takes the orders said she did not know the quantity! She said the dishes are for two people. When the food arrived, we saw that it was enough for one or a maximum of one and a half people. My wife and I are not big eaters. And it was not 550 grams of rice! It was less. I really do not know what they mean by writing 550 grams. Maybe with all the side dishes or I do not know …",Negative

In the end, I am happy to have met Shiraz Burger.",Positive

"It was really the worst food I've eaten in my 28 years of life. The rice was inedible. I've never seen rice like this. The way it was cooked was like starch. The kebab was also very bad, and the cooking was very bad. Why should it have a high rating on Snapp Food?",Negative
It was excellent. The quality was high. The food was cooked well and arrived on time. The food was still warm. The packaging was excellent. I recommend that Snapp foodies definitely try this restaurant's chicken. It's excellent.,Positive
"Yogurt ice cream arrived completely melted. I want to emphasize that it was just water. Besides the order should be put in such a way that the ice cream doesn't soak in, but if it does get a little slack, it's not a problem. This ice cream was just water, which means it had a quality defect. Cappuccino was not delivered, and an extra drink cake was sent, which was fixed by support. However, I am generally satisfied with this supermarket. I just want to understand the ice cream issue.",Negative
I had ordered a kilo of potatoes and they sent me two potatoes the size of a baby's head.,Negative

"Hello. I do not have any problem with the quality of the food. First of all, the delivery person did not drop off the food at the door, he left it in the elevator. Is it that hard to add some sauce with the pizza? It did not have any special packaging either. The same old dry pizza box! They should not have to be reminded about such small things",Negative
"It was like 30 centimeters? I measured its length, width, and diameter and it was no more than 20 centimeters. What is this? It was really bad",Negative

Fast and complete. Thanks to the store management and Snap,Positive
"The food was tasty and excellent, but they didn't bring one of the pizzas. Since they hadn't put it on the bill, I didn't give it too much thought.

The chicken is dry and tasteless,Negative

Furthermore, I asked them to include onions and pickled cabbage along with the food, but they didn't! I hope you won't lose customers so easily. Customers are the crown jewel of your business",Negative

"I ordered ham and steak pizza, but the pizza sent was just ham, no steak",Negative
"The mushroom and meat pizza didn't taste like anything. The money that this pizza cost. You really can't trust everyone. We should go somewhere that we know their pizza is great.

"The expiration date of the syrup has not yet expired, but out of a one-year period, it is eight months old. I would not have picked this product in person when shopping, but now I have no choice.",Negative
It didn't taste like pizza at all. You had just passed the pizza cheese by it.,Negative
You had not sent the sauce. You usually put a thin layer of barbecue sauce on the bottom of the container. You hadn't sent that with the fried chicken either.,Negative
"Unfortunately, the delivery man's behavior was very bad.",Negative
"Unfortunately, the pizza was very cold! And this was my first time ordering from this restaurant. I don't know if it's because of the discount or this is usually how it is.

I love the cookies you send with the order. Best of luck.,Positive

"The turkey pizza was not good, but the Alfredo was excellent.",Positive

"The Ghormeh Sabzi was very tasty... Although it also had black lemons, it was not bitter at all and tasted very good. It was just a little spicy, but the high quality of the food made up for it. Overall, it was very good. Thank you.",Positive

"This was my first time ordering, and as always, it was great!",Positive
Very poor quality,Negative
"The courier was very late. The delivery was made after an hour instead of 30 minutes. Food's sauce packaging was very inappropriate, so that all the sauces and even the salad were spilled in the bag and on all the food. Of course, maybe the courier was negligent in carrying it, and if so, he must have crashed into a truck, which is why the sauces and salad were spilled and opened to this extent.",Negative
The chicken meat for this round was raw.,Negative
Very cold and poor quality.,Negative

For the second time they have sent the food to the wrong address. It finally got to me cold and the noodles were all stuck to each other.,Negative
"Unfortunately, I ordered a Bandar sandwich, but they sent me a chicken and mayonnaise sandwich. The name and phone number of another person was on the bill, and I am really unhappy. It seems as if the food in the restaurant was mixed up. Because the courier called me and told me that my food had arrived, I went and picked it up. But the name on the bill and the type of food did not match what I had ordered. I waited for half an hour so that I would not take someone else's food.",Negative
Bad delivery by Snapp.,Negative
Very ordinary. I didn't enjoy eating it at all. It only filled my stomach.,Negative
"The food was good quality, but the packaging of the baghali ghatogh was really bad and was not a suitable container for this use. The packaging was so bad that all of the excessive oil from the dish had spilled into the bag, and likewise it had seeped into all the other food. We had a hard time opening the food and everything was covered in grease.",Negative

When the pizza arrived it was cold and needed warming up.,Negative

The chicken was small and burnt. The rice was of poor quality.,Negative
"The lentil soup had too much lemon juice, it seemed that it was leftover lentil soup to which they had added lemon juice to remove the stale taste.",Negative

"The salad was good, only the amount of lettuce was much more than the other ingredients such as fruit, bell pepper and celery.",Negative

The sweets were fresh but the quality of the materials was very low and the cream was very very sweet and the bananas used were old.,Negative
Very dissatisfied with the ring cream placed under the sun. So much that the cream came out and melted.

The hamburger was extremely tasteless unlike the great hot dogs.,Negative

"This is the second time that the quality of the sandwich has gone down so much. The bread was not sliced properly and the contents of the sandwich were almost outside and inside the paper. The quality of the fillet inside the sandwich was very low and almost uncooked. Previously, they used to send handmade white sauce with the sandwich, which this time was not the case. Unfortunately, I do not know why when a place gets a name, its quality should go down so much. I personally will not order from Baguette anymore",Negative

Excellent. Light and delicious,Positive
"The amount of rice was small, it did not taste good, the quality of the chicken was very low, it was stale and tough.

But thank you for your efforts and really, thank you for your hard work",Positive
"Along with the fried chicken that is on the menu, there is also a cabbage salad on the menu that was not delivered. It is appropriate that if there is a change in the combination of food, the menu must be corrected",Positive

They only put a lot of pizza cheese on the bread,Negative
One of the order items (full-fat milk) has not been delivered,Negative

If they want to charge extra for mushroom sauce, they should include it in the menu so we can order it or at least call us to tell us if we want sauce, it has an extra cost.

The Turkish kebab was also very salty which was irritating, if only you would maintain the quality…",Negative
"It's as if Iranian restaurants are in the habit of making food that is a different quality each time you order, as if they bring in a new chef each time! I thought Barooj would be different because I had been satisfied with its quality most of the time, so I confidently ordered two chicken strips at once. But as luck would have it, it was not the same as always, the fillets were not tender and did not have the unique Barooj flavor and I completely regretted it, if only I had ordered one! For a time, I had become addicted to your chicken strips, but now I am completely put off them for a while! Thank you so much for helping society break bad habits with your inconsistent quality!!!",Negative

3 broken eggs and a substitution in the freezer bag,Negative
"The food was very healthy and delicious, the barley bread was very tasty and the barbecue sauce was exceptional. Because the sandwich was put in a plastic bag, the bread became doughy. It would be better if it were sent in the same paper bag as before. It did not seem that natural lemon juice had been added to the mojito",Positive

"Unfortunately they delivered with a 20 minute delay ... if someone is in a hurry, it was a long delay",Negative

I ordered Caesar salad and received a container of salad that looked like regular salad with a few small pieces of bread and chicken!!!! This dish is worth 8000 Tomans at best. They charged 31000 Tomans for the food and sold it with a discount of 18000 Tomans. While this food is not even worth 8000 Tomans. I suggest you order a Caesar salad from other restaurants at least once to understand what Caesar salad is!!!!,Negative
The kebab smelled weird. And the food wasn't very warm,Negative

Awful. The volume of the food was low and it was actually worthless.,Negative

"Hi, I'm tired of saying this was my first time ordering, the quality was excellent, the meat was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious, the rice was excellent, the delivery driver and delivery time were on time and the service was good, but the only criticism I have is that I didn't like that you put the meat container next to the rice, it crushed the rice on one side, and the container that was placed on top of everything and touched should not have been placed on the rice, it was not hygienically correct and it did not look good, otherwise everything else was excellent.

"Strengths: My order was delivered in less than ten minutes. Weakness: For example, there were two pieces of fried chicken, but it was so small and dry that it wasn't even half a thigh for the whole two pieces of meat!! It was very dark. They had just added a mountain of potatoes on it. I felt more like eating potatoes with sauce than fried chicken! I was not satisfied at all",Negative
The food delivery time was unacceptable and the food arrived cold and of poor quality,Negative
It was too sweet. Regular baklava is even better than them. It's very expensive compared to the quality and quantity,Negative
One of the worst chicken strips I've ever had. It was clear that it was made with stale oil. The crispy part stuck to the chicken was all detached,Negative
"Unfortunately, it took 2 hours for the food to be delivered. The pizza was cold and its dough wasn't fresh. I very regret my trust and order",Negative

Everything was really good,Positive
"Except for the mandarin which was stale, the apples were good and the cucumbers, tomatoes, and potatoes were excellent and their weight was correct. I wish that in cases where the fruit isn’t fresh you would let us know so that we can change the order. Many thanks",Positive
Unfortunately the barley they brought was hot; they should bring people’s orders from the refrigerator,Negative
It wasn’t as spicy as I wanted. Make it spicier. But the quality of the meat was excellent,Positive

As good as the kebabs at highway restaurants,Positive
"Your Tahchin Geymeh familiarized us with a new flavor. A bit different from Geymeh, but acceptable",Positive

They don’t use fresh ingredients. The salad lettuce was extremely stale and old. The sandwich bread also wasn’t fresh unfortunately,Negative
It wasn’t spicy at all while I had ordered it spicy; the bread was also very stale. I didn’t like it,Negative
"Upon delivery, the food was so cold that we had to heat it up in a pot. It wasn’t even lukewarm. Cold, cold! Heating up the stew because it’s served with vegetables is hard because you first have to separate them and then heat it up in another container",Negative
The packaging of their salads has changed; it’s cool but the volume of the salad has gone down,Positive
The croissants were extremely bitter and awful; they only had a pea’s worth of chocolate in them,Negative

Spinach salad is awesome only on holidays they finish it early,Positive
Amazing as always. Thanks.,Positive
"I love it this salad, awesome, the amount of different ingredient is in proportion with each other, it is not like other places that put one kilo of lettuce with two grams of chicken in front of you, its so yummy, only the size of lettuce is a little big",Positive
It arrived very fast and was warm and good only the chips and cheese was very different than I thought and was really small,Positive
It was normal! Lettuce and sauce! Of course the sauce was not mayonnaise!,Positive
The ice-creams were completely melted and unusable,Negative
Pizza was cold and the amount of ingredients in comparison with the bread was few and was almost dry,Negative
No way you can call half a chicken and pomegranate sauce Akbar Joojeh!!!!!! The chicken was not fried properly and was very thick and its pomegranate sauce was of those ready packs (like sauce) which had industrial flavor and was not interesting …I suggest you remove Akbar Joojeh from you menu and do not question the name and credit of Akbar Joojeh!,Negative
Lettuce was very very clean and good. Istanbul potatoes would be better if it was not muddy. The amount of rocket inside the package should be less in my opinion. It was too much and pressed and had wilted inside.,Negative
This time in contrast to always the desserts were assorted very disorderly,Negative
Cut the hot-dog to be cooked better. Thanks. But it was good,Positive
"The price of sandwich in comparison with its size and the ingredients used was too much and also no where they take price for a sauce but here, special sauce which was only combination of tomato and chilly cost 1500 Toman apart from the sandwich, Argentine cocktail was at all not fried and was raw. Overall I was not satisfied",Negative
"Always on time and with fresh ingredients, I hope you always remain like this",Positive

I think all their sandwiches are great.,Positive
The quality and quantity of food has decreased.,Negative
"Approximately 20 can become 17, not 16, certainly not 13. It is not right to order for a group with this information and then not have enough for some. Although it was really delicious and arrived on time.",Positive
It was the first time that it arrived on time. The quality of the purchased product was also good.,Positive
It was really the worst sandwich of my life.,Negative
"Very bad taste. Please respect the customer. Bad taste of meat, tough meat, and low quality of raw materials and bad taste.",Negative
Delicious but veryyyy cold.,Positive
They brought it very quickly. I think it took 10 minutes. A very polite young man. Only that the baklava was not crispy and fresh. It was soft and stale. The quality of Nutley has been low for a long time. I am much more satisfied with Tina's quality.,Positive
"You had fancy packaging but the food was very cold as if it had been put in the refrigerator. We pay to eat hot food, not cold.",Negative
"The pizza that was delivered was a very small pizza, so much so that the 24 cm diameter that was mentioned was like a joke! In addition, the pizza was very low-volume despite being American. Again, it was neither American nor like their own photo. And most importantly, considering that I was tracking it from the app and Snapp Food delivered it to me very quickly, the pizza was completely cold and stale, as if someone else's canceled pizza had been sent for me!!! It is absolutely not possible that the pizza completely and to this extent became cold on the way because it was not even lukewarm. It was definitely cold when it was given to Snapp. And fourth, the request for extra sauce and a few paper towels and chili peppers was completely ignored. I am completely dissatisfied with Piano.",Negative
It was good but it has become smaller than before and it is not interesting to pay tax.,Positive
"We ordered Nan Avaran packed bread. They sent us something else! If they didn't have it, they shouldn't have sent it. We asked for two Sanistar orange juices, again, they sent something else and its packaging was crushed! I was really upset.",Negative
The pizza was very tasty and arrived hot. The price is also very reasonable relative to the quality!,Positive
"It was really tasteless and didn't taste good at all. Three different models, one of which tasted like ginger which was really bad and the other two were completely bland. By the way, they were very small and not worth the price at all. I didn't like it.",Negative
"Although we were close, it arrived very late and did not include the selected flavors.",Negative
"As always, excellent quality. Thank you for your good restaurant.",Positive
The packaging was very good.,Positive
"The delivery person's attitude was bad, the food was good",Positive
"Since Barooj opened in Hyperstar, I have been ordering pizza from them both in person and online because their pizzas are delicious and the bread is crispy and good, but the fried shrimp was really bad, it didn't taste like shrimp at all because it was so dry, they had cut the shrimp in half and fried it with breadcrumbs, it tasted like just breadcrumbs. Even though shrimp is an expensive food, I didn't eat more than two or three of them and the rest remained... Oh, now that I'm complaining, I also ordered onion rings in person and they were very doughy, I couldn't eat those either. But thank you for your great pizzas",Positive
"You order a sandwich at a high price from Longin expecting good quality and size, not for them to bring you chicken that smells bad with stale bread that you eat forcibly and only because you're hungry... You do well in terms of increasing prices, but the quality needs to be preserved",Negative
The portion size was not appropriate compared to the price,Negative
"1 fruit juice is missing, please send it. I ordered 36, there were 35",Positive

This salad was not appropriate for the restaurant's reputation,Negative
"It was very bad, really, I didn't expect such a pizza",Negative
"The food unfortunately arrived very, very, very late and also the special potatoes were not good at all and the cheese was not melted properly. The Apple pizzas are good, but they really shouldn't be delivered so late",Negative
The delivery time needs to be shorter,Positive
"The courier's behavior was not appropriate at all and he waited at the bottom of the building and called me to come down and pick it up and since my phone was on silent, I didn't notice and he got demanding as to why I don't answer the phone when it was his duty to bring it upstairs and deliver the food",Negative
"After 3 times of follow-ups again I didn't receive my order, I'm very dissatisfied from both the supermarket and SnappMarket",Negative
"Amazing like always, enjoy your profit",Positive
"It arrived late and was cold, but very delicious",Positive/Negative
"You arrived in less than five minutes, thank you very much",Positive

"The fried chicken was amazing but the fried fillet neither had its number mentioned in the menu or a reasonable price, there were only 3 pieces of fillet for a high price and the fried shrimp didn't have its number mentioned in the menu, which was 7 pieces in total and it was reasonably priced, in general and aside from these critiques the meal was hot, perfect and well packaged",Positive/Negative
The meat was tough and overcooked. It was like dry bread and it had very little side dishes. I won't order food from Sheila's Modesty anymore,Negative
"Again as usual, despite the fact that I have spoken to the support center about this issue many times, they have changed my order to their liking without coordinating it with me. I don't think it's a difficult thing to call me",Negative

"Hello. Unfortunately, one cornflakes was missing which was refunded after coordination with support. I hope that more care is taken in future deliveries and that the delivery driver gets a receipt from the customer upon delivery. Because after the delivery, contacting support and saying that an item was missing makes you feel bad, which is not pleasant, especially if it happens frequently",Positive
Hello. We ordered a kids meal but the toy that was advertised was not included. We want that. Please make sure that the picture you show is the same as what you deliver. My brother ordered because he wanted the toy and now he is constantly bothering us because he is crying,Negative
"I selected the more expensive cigarettes without pictures, but they sent them with pictures",Negative
It was excellent along with the reasonable price,Positive
"Hello. The delay was more than 1 hour and 40 minutes. The food was almost completely cold. The size of the kebab was noticeably smaller. For three dishes, one piece of onion and half a lemon. The delivery driver also demanded money from the customer as if the customer was late. Friends, it has become an epidemic. For a while, they provide good service, and when they gain customers, they cut from everything they can",Negative
It took more than an hour and a half for the food to arrive. I will not order food from you again,Negative
The chicken recently smells gamey,Negative
"I said for 50,000 tomans, what kind of kebab will they send. With meat and rice that are better quality and definitely better prices, there are other options. In addition, the kebab was not cooked",Negative

A good restaurant is not just about good food; everything about it should be good. Anyway, the taste of the food was good. But I will not order again because I lost face in front of my friend",Negative
"The quality of the food was very bad. The stew was more like water than Gheime. There were only about 10 lentils that were crushed, and its water was exactly like that of water stew with a lot of fat, and its meat was two pieces with a lot of fat. In short, it was rice with water stew. I will not buy from this restaurant anymore",Negative
"The pepperoni pizza was excellent, but it had little sauce. The mixed pizza was a little wet and had not been baked",Positive
"I must first say that I was very satisfied with their delivery person. He came on time and was a very polite gentleman. However, I will get to the main point! First of all, I ordered a family-size can of soda, and they sent me a Coca-Zero. I do not understand how, when someone has not ordered a zero, they decide to send a zero on their own accord?! You must know that it is very bad-tasting! Now, the food: The potatoes did not have any spices and were very bland (the mushroom sauce was not bad). I encountered some very hard white things in the meat of the main dish, which were not one or two!!!! It meant that my tooth could have broken. Unfortunately, I could not even eat half of the burger",Negative
Chicken stunk and used outdated eggs or did not keep it properly,Negative

"We ordered bread, it was very hard and cold",Negative
I received the pizza all crushed up,Negative
Very cold and low quality - It seemed like their only intention was to deliver something to you so that you couldn't say they didn't deliver! As my first order from Snapp food it was a complete disaster! But I still ordered again. This is the third time and I'm waiting for it to arrive to make my final conclusion,Negative

"Only and only the steak and pepper pizza, their other foods are normal, but I would not give their steak and pepper pizza for the world, it is wonderful.",Positive

Can't you help Snapfood with the delivery cost being so high?,Positive

"Its quality was excellent, it just had two problems, the first was that the mushrooms were too salty and the second is a piece of sausage that calls into question such a sandwich",Positive

"The milk was warm, which indicates that it was not taken out of their fridge, but the delivery speed was good.",Positive

It was delivered in 10 minutes. You're always great,Positive
"The quality of the food is good, but I wish they wouldn't put pepper on the potatoes. I order potatoes for my child.

The delivery fee was expensive,Negative

The food was cold and the quality of the food was average in comparison to the price.,Negative
"The pizza had everything in it except meat, and it was not an American pizza at all, it was an Italian pizza that was only dough with some pizza cheese and that was a little bit showy in the middle. Until some time ago, the pizza for two was like a giant and no one could eat it, but now the portion of the food is so small that even with a large fries, one cannot be full; in short, it is not very appealing and why waste time and money here when there are so many restaurants.",Negative

Excellent thank you to Snappfood and Ne'mati bakery,Positive
The food only had volume. The chicken had no flavor at all. It was cold too. A tasteless and bland food. It only had volume. But no quality at all. The chicken was not bad the last time. How is it possible for chicken to have no flavor at all. They delivered the food very quickly. But it was cold. That's weird.,Negative
The food was above average but it was so late that I got full,Negative

For packaging, they had put a bag much smaller than the size of the order and had not even tied it up so that the order would not fall, and when the delivery man put the order in front of the unit door, half of the orders fell which was not acceptable in terms of health at all. If you do not choose a larger bag, at least make a simple knot",Negative

This confectionery does not have the same quality as before! The pastries did not taste good at all.,Negative
"At the time of order, the delivery time was set to about 50 minutes, but the order arrived 7 minutes late, the delivery man did not know that it had been paid online and I had to explain, the quality of the garlic bread was really bad and it seemed like it was just bread and a little cheese, the taste of garlic was not noticeable at all, the pizza dough was tough, I expected a lot more from Baro's, given my previous experiences, but I was really disappointed, my only favorites were the mojito, the fried mushrooms, and the fried chicken was relatively good, but the rest was really disappointing, or maybe my expectations from Baro's were high!",Negative

The quality of the food is excellent and it arrived fresh and warm in a short period of time.,Positive
"Hello and thank you. Please add more sour cherries. Considering that the distance to the delivery location is 1-7 kilometers, it does not make sense to charge 5000 Tomans, besides, the delivery fee on the receipt is 0 Tomans! Please reconsider.",Positive

"We always buy from Natali confectionery and the quality is excellent, but my first order experience through Snappfood ended very badly! I ordered two types of pastries, one of which was simple cream bread, which when they brought it I saw that it was from their dark-colored cream bread model, which is larger and brown in color and tastes completely different!!! The other model was chocolate, which they called and said that this model is finished, and should we bring you another type of chocolate that is only different in design? I emphasized again and said that if only the design is different but it is chocolate, bring it. Unfortunately, when they brought it, we saw that it was Nescafe!!! Unfortunately, we opened the boxes late and there was no longer an opportunity to protest, but always at the same moment that you receive the pastries, check it immediately so that there is no discrepancy. It was really strange, and Natali's first-class quality was questionable with this action of theirs",Negative
Why do they put things that they don't have on the list to cancel it?,Negative

The apple was good. But the pizza was very bad. Cheese and meat and ...,Negative
The bread was stale and the chicken was cold,Negative
"First of all I should start with the good packaging and complete ingredients. The volume of the food was very good and the quality of the food was also good and the amount of chicken inside the tahchin was excellent. Only the rice was very unsalted and a little lumpy and also the chicken inside the food had no specific spices and flavor. If the rice is cooked harder and the chicken is flavored, for example tomato paste is added to it, it will be excellent.",Positive

"Hello, friends. I suggest you try these. It was very delicious. It even arrived warm and was not doughy at all. It is worth going out, parking, and more importantly, standing in line in the cold. Thank you very much for this great service",Positive

"Its size was very small. Instead of snacks, there was only mushroom. There were only 2 or 3 snacks and it arrived very late. Even though we were very close, the food was cold",Negative

It was bad. It was the worst order I have ever received. Their big cup was that small. God bless their smaller cup,Negative

"Hello. The Snapp deliveryman was very polite and respectful. The quality of the gheymeh was not so good, and the soup they sent tasted bad and seemed like a mixture of leftover food that was not edible. The food packaging is very bad.

"Hello, although the coconut biscuit health expired until 1398, it was completely old and almost smelled bad, and it is likely that the box was not its own and had been changed inside... The price on the macaroni sauce was also 4100 Tomans, which was 4500. Also, cappuccino. Wrote 20 pieces in the product name, which probably means 1 piece?? which should be corrected.

"The food was extremely low quality and cold; The pizza with dry, cold and uncooked barley bread reached my hand and the color of the pizza was not pleasant at all. The fried chicken seemed to be boiled and did not taste fried! They put the bread that was sent with the fried chicken in the fried chicken container and the potatoes under the chicken, which caused the bread to become wet and soft! There were a few uncooked potatoes in the container. Overall the quality was very bad and this means that I will never buy from any of Baghuette branches and I don't recommend it to anyone. When the order was delayed, I contacted the restaurant but the lady who takes the orders replied, I sent the order but because of you, I had a 50T fine, I sent the order from Andarzgo to Niavaran in the rain!!! The only thing that was according to my request and tasted the same as always was the Fanta drink, which fortunately its preparation was not up to the Baghuette restaurant ...",Negative
"The food tasted good but was not excellent. Because the beef is very cold and the cabbage is also cold and bloated, I recommend using lettuce instead of cabbage and also a little cinnamon in the ingredients of this sandwich improves its taste and neutralizes the coldness of the meat. Mushroom sauce plays an important role in the taste of roast beef, but it is not very noticeable in your sandwich",Positive

It tasted good but was too spicy. The quality of the ingredients was also good compared to the price. I just didn't understand why the oil was completely yellow! Its ingredients should have been red. It was also very greasy which is somewhat natural. The descriptions were not paid attention to either. In general, it was worth trying once. Good luck",Positive

The quality of the chicken and soup is excellent but it was very cold. Even if the food is good, it's no use if it gets cold. Both our appetites were spoiled because it was late, and it was so cold and tasteless that I put the food aside to heat it up and only ate the soup. I doubt I will order from this restaurant a third time. Good luck",Negative

Very fast and neat. I wish ice creams were put in separate plastic so they would not be damaged under the other items,Positive

"I think that during the cooking time, a bag of salt from the chef accidentally spilled into the Qormeh stew. Then they didn't have any more salt, so they didn't add any salt to their coupon soup. As salty as the stew was, so the soup didn't have any salt at all",Negative
The pizza was completely Italian and excellent. The salad was very good for the price,Positive

"The dough of the wrap was good, but the ingredients inside were very bad. It smelled really bad, as if you were eating cartilage instead of meat.

The volume is good and the taste is great,Positive
"I have been a customer of this restaurant for a long time and have always been satisfied, but the last time the quality of the food had dropped significantly and I can almost say that the food was inedible. It seemed that the food ingredients were stale and the food tasted very, very bad. The decrease in the volume of rice was also a noteworthy point that disappointed me in this order.

I was not satisfied at all today. Why didn't you send butter? The bread is not fresh at all. Very bad,Negative
You are great Satori thank you Snappfood,Positive
"There is really no more joy, the doner meat is so fatty that you eat two bites and you get full, the chicken was good before, but this time I got it was really salty, even I, who always eat salty, say it was salty, the potato was not bad, but It is interesting that the potato container was in the bag and there was no cover on it!

You have very delicious waffles,Positive
"The food was completely cold when it arrived, the potatoes weren't fresh at all and were also cold and dry, the chicken was ok but wasn't very fresh either the most important thing is that the coleslaw that came with the order had been kept in the freezer and was frozen, it was completely frozen and the color of the ingredients inside had changed",Negative

"Instead of chicken pizza that we ordered, they sent a margherita pizza which was also cheaper …",Negative
Thank you for the good customer service of VIP Hyper Fruit Plus,Positive
The attitude of the motorcyclist was very polite and calm,Positive

It was not similar to the stew at all…very tasteless.,Negative
"With regard to the short path to the destination and ordering a cold and prepared meal, it took a long time for it to be delivered",Negative
The food was warm and arrived in a timely manner. The amount of ingredients on the pizza was enough and it tasted good,Positive

"The chicken leg was good, but the potato was not good at all",Negative
"I am a customer of this supermarket and I have always been satisfied, but unfortunately the price of Nescafe was 9 Tomans more expensive than other supermarkets in the same area. I noticed it after I bought it. In these days of inflation it is unfair to play this game of old purchase new purchase with customers.",Negative
We were regular customers. Why did you decrease your service area?,Negative
The taste of the food wasn’t bad but the quality of the food was not good compared to its price… also the delivery man brought the food on time,Positive

It was very tasty and delicious,Positive

"The delivery person put the food in the elevator, I don't know what to say",Negative
The bottom of the tomato or the stalk of the cabbage and lettuce should be thrown away not minced into the sandwich and then instead of plenty of cheese write plenty of cabbage lettuce and mushrooms for my sandwich. There was no sign of plenty of cheese in my sandwich.,Negative

"It was the worst pizza I've ever eaten, I will not order from this restaurant again, I was embarrassed in front of my guest, the pizza was cold and it looked like it came from the third world war, it was crumpled and messy in the box, I have a picture of it, if the restaurant manager, God forbid, thinks about the customer, I will send it to him.",Negative
The stew was completely cold,Negative
"It was great regardless of whether it's healthy or not, but it tasted great",Positive
"Compared to other times, it was older and had less chocolate",Negative
Hello. The chicken kebabs were more or less burnt. This is the only restaurant that does not put a lemon next to the kebab (for the second time and despite registering an opinion last time). I would appreciate it if these comments are addressed. Customers spend this time to improve the services and eliminate defects. Thanks,Negative
"I don't know where this score of 4.6 comes from. This is the third time I have ordered from this supermarket and they have sent me whatever they wanted. Instead of 5 colorful wafers, they sent a weird wafer with an unknown brand name, instead of a chocolate croissant, they sent me a coconut croissant, instead of Action gum, they sent an Orbit Eucalyptus. What is this situation?",Negative
"All the food I have received so far has been excellent. It is of high quality and very, very delicious. Especially its special potatoes, which are amazing.",Positive

"It was cold, the quality was low, it reached me late, the volume was low",Negative
"There are two objections to the prices: 1- The price on the package of almonds is 14000 Tomans. The supermarket has registered the price on the website and invoice as 16000 Tomans. That is, 2000 Tomans more expensive. 2- The price on the dried fig box has been erased with a fingernail. The supermarket has registered the price on the website and invoice as 35000 Tomans. The previous price of this product was 25000 Tomans. That is, it is now registered 10,000 Tomans more expensive. Please check it out. I used the discount code. What was the use?!",Negative

"Zig Zag is great, we are also their in-person customers, attention to detail is the most important thing for them",Positive
"I think it was more like bread and cheese, the greens were minimal for it to be a cheesecake",Negative
It seems to be extremely low quality. It's very small and low volume compared to its price. It was my first and last time ordering. I don't know how they can sell a cheap pizza instead of an expensive one. I have never eaten such a low-quality pizza in my life. But it was an experience...,Negative
"As always, I wrote in the description that I wanted less cheese, but it wasn't low on cheese. As always, it was delicious and hot, but please pay attention to the descriptions. Thank you.",Positive

Very first-class and delicious,Positive

"You used to be more precise. Recently, you have not been sending one or two of the purchases every time",Negative
"Tonight, I ordered a serving of Tahchin Lobia Polo. You registered the order at 6:50 and delivered it to me at 8:50. That is, 2 hours and this means mismanagement. The delivered food was cold. And what surprised me the most was that the food was placed in the carton without any covering, and in my opinion, this is bad. I have never encountered such a thing. And the quality of the food was lower than an ordinary food. And of course, I will not order from you anymore.",Negative
Many thanks for your services in these difficult days.,Positive
"Excellent, excellent, it was a little cold, but it was delicious and excellent",Positive
"Why doesn't the supermarket bring us exactly what we mark and the flavors we want!!!? How many times! Every time I say they will get better, but every time it's wrong! Well, what does Snapp do in between! Follow up! There are so many better supermarkets around us that you can try others too. Maybe they will deliver the goods more correctly!",Negative
"Excellent and great, thanks a lot",Positive
It was not good at all. We did not feel well until the next day after eating this food,Negative

"The courier said, ""Come to the door and pick up the delivery."" If I wanted to go to the door, I would go to the supermarket at the end of the alley myself!!",Negative
"The taste of the pizza was not bad, but it was not professional at all. It was clear from the appearance of the pizza that considering its price, the quality of the pizza was low. I myself had previously taken your sirloin pizza, and the cheese that was on the pizza, that quality and color and style did not exist in it at all.",Negative
If they put a little more sauce it would be great. The quality of their pizza has been very good in these few orders,Positive
It was good. It arrived on time. The quality was acceptable for the price. Thanks,Positive

It was very very good,Positive

The food was good and of good quality,Positive
The packaging was excellent,Positive
The chicken tasted stale,Negative
"Thank you, the quality was good",Positive
"The food was too salty... It would be better to use less oil in the food. The potatoes were old. One coleslaw for 5 pieces of chicken is not enough. They should put at least two... The coleslaw isn't tasty either. It would be better to put a palatable salad on top of the extra cost of food and the ten-Toman delivery fee and tax, which is really high. It would be better to reduce it to keep your customers",Negative
They put too much mayonnaise sauce in the sandwich!!!,Negative
"The quality of tangerines and oranges was not good, they were not fresh",Negative

It was a bit dry :(,Negative
The packaging paper was of very poor quality and the pizza cheese was stuck to the container,Negative
"Overall it was very good, both the order taking and the delivery. Just one minor criticism, which is that I have seen several times that Snapp Express sends the delivery confirmation to the customer a few minutes early! (I have also seen a case where it was 30 minutes early), which makes me feel that it is not registering the delay! From the customer's point of view, this is not a problem, but if it becomes the norm, it will not lead to good results in the end",Positive
The bread was very small and it arrived late,Negative
"The price of the fruits in this supermarket is very expensive and I bought an avocado for 41 thousand tomans with a Snapp discount code, but unfortunately instead of an avocado stalk, they brought a small avocado",Negative
The delivery speed and quality of the food was very good,Positive
The food quality was very good.,Positive
The packaging was excellent. The Tabriz meatballs tasted good but were a little spicy. The soup was amazing! Thank you so much,Positive

"Hello, I bought from the supermarket and ordered Della cookies with chocolate chips, but instead they sent apple and cinnamon without coordination, which we do not like at all. Please let us know if they are not available, or refund our money or coordinate to replace them with another product and in addition to losing trust, it will cause uncertainty in ordering online and finally this product is useless to us, good luck",Negative

I think if you use better quality ingredients, the snacks themselves can become a delicious and popular dish, for example, bacon and spinach snacks, or pepperoni snacks, or garlic and steak snacks, etc. In short, it's a pity!

"Both sandwiches were smaller than half of their original size!!! With a price that was always at least 1.5 times the standard, this small amount of food is nothing but an insult to the customer!!!",Negative

I hope the management considers this carefully.",Negative
Why are you so good? It has arrived warm in this cold weather. Thanks.,Positive

"The quality of the baguette bread was good but it was not sesame which was replaced and two tomans were also returned in the bag but two were sent instead of four, which means two plain baguettes were not sent but the quality of their baguette is very good",Negative
"1. When shipping charges are charged, why is there an insistence on ordering over 20 thousand tomans? 2. I had asked for the dumplings to be sent in a box but they were sent in a disposable container. 3. Before this order, I had placed another order and with a lot of delay they contacted me that it was not available, it is better to update the stock",Negative
The pizza was very cold when I took it.,Negative

"We ordered four types of cucumber candy, all four of them were probably those that the customers hadn't purchased, the ones mixed with pepper; both of the brands were sent mistakenly; I think that when purchasing online, the best types of products should be sent so that customers can trust the seller and become loyal, not that the products are replaced; with previous orders, we hadn't been sensitive about the flavors of ice cream, but these products are inedible; I think I've been a good customer so far, but we had the trouble of digesting these products",Negative
It's amazing in this area,Positive
"I ordered a roast beef sandwich and a different sandwich arrived, filled with sausage and a bit of chicken meat! I was not at all satisfied",Negative

"The cakes that were in the petit four box got mixed up and came out of their original shapes due to bad handling and careless transportation; I wanted to take this box to a party, but it's so messed up that it's impossible; I truly regret placing this order, considering I paid so much for it; I'm absolutely not satisfied and I will definitely inform my friends and acquaintances to not order from them",Negative

The pizza was as small as the palm of your hand,Negative
"We understand that the food prices have increased, but decreasing the size of the chicken kebabs to keep the customers in a way that we have not increased the prices is a wrong move and the customer loses trust. Also, the salad and mashed potatoes looked old. Thank God we did not serve them to the guests",Negative

It didn't have potatoes, despite what the picture showed. However, there was a large volume. I don't know if this is normal but basil was also sent with the food.

I had to contact support so they can refund the difference. I waited in the queue and it wasted more time than the refund was worth, so I just let it go. The money is not important.

Then my colleague came and said that your order has arrived!!!!! Please deliver it to the person in person and also the mini لقمه روگن is much smaller than the five centimeters that it says. Worse, four white breads were put in the twenty-piece روگن package!!! If your delivery agent had given it to me, I would have returned the mini روگن order!!! I was satisfied with this fantasy bread before, but they do something that makes you regret it!!! It's fresh, but it's strange to put regular bread in a روگن package.

Another issue is that I always get bone-like pieces under my teeth, as if they put the meat and bone in a meat grinder together. I will not order koobideh anymore, I don't know where you get your meat from, I hope you fix it, koobideh is a popular dish.",Negative

This was the first time that this restaurant disappointed me. The kebab was very hard and the chicken was not that good either,Negative

"It was very fresh and tasty, thank you",Positive
"I liked it very much, I will order it again",Positive
"In terms of the quality and freshness of the ingredients, both in the salad and in the döner sandwich, I was satisfied. It was very fresh and good. But unfortunately, there was a spice added to the chicken in the sandwich that made me unable to eat more than two bites, and it didn't smell good. In addition, the sandwich was full of onions mixed with red cabbage, etc. Of course, onions make food taste better, but not everyone likes them or, like me, their stomach is sensitive and they can't eat them.

Because I threw the packages in the garbage tunnel immediately and there is no access to them",Positive

"The pizza was very good, the potato was not interesting",Positive
"It was a very, very delicious breakfast, nothing was missing, the packaging was excellent. The puree flavor was excellent, the only flaw, which is of course a matter of taste in my opinion, was that the amount of sauce, which of course tasted very good, was so much that it had completely soaked the omelet. I think this sauce can be sent in a separate container for different tastes. Thank you again for taking care of everything.",Positive
"The volume of macaroni had decreased compared to before, and the amount of mushroom and meat had decreased significantly.",Negative
"It was very, very sweet. The sweet tongue, sweet butter with a small amount of sugar. Not that it should be weighed down with sugar and water, I think half a kilo of it was sugar syrup.",Negative
I always used to order sumac and basil burger because you put basil in it. But today you put lettuce and a few small withered basil seeds. It didn't taste good at all.,Negative

Now I don't know what to do with these items",Negative

"The delivery time of the order was longer than the estimated time, since I am an old customer of Parprok, I recommended the good quality of the food of this restaurant to everyone, but this time I was very taken aback when I found part of a spoon or disposable fork in the chicken pizza. I think there should be more supervision over the quality of the cooking of the food",Negative
"The food was cold, the chicken smelled a little bit, the pizza bread wasn't crispy. Before the food at Baguette was better",Negative
"It was okay I will give it 5 stars, the flavor, the volume and the quality were good. In terms of packaging and side dishes you have no equal in Iran. I suggest that there be less aromatic herbs in the meat sauce",Positive
But overall it was okay,Positive
The food had gotten very cold. The wrapping was not at an excellent level. The chicken was okay,Negative

Very good and quality arrived at the scheduled time,Positive
Very punctual hot and delicious as always very good,Positive
"If you do not have a product, do not send a substitute that is not similar to the first product and only the price is the same. These two packs of paper towels that you sent me are not useful for me",Negative
"Recently, the pizzas have not been fully cooked and do not have that old crispiness and are somewhat doughy",Negative
It was delicious and had a lot of volume. Lentil rice can easily feed two people,Positive
"Apple only has a name and attractive packaging, but the quality is very ordinary and its price is very high compared to the food it has",Negative
"The food was delicious and the spinach gave it a different taste, but unfortunately it was a little cold",Positive

Everything was great and very delicious,Positive
The cheesecake was a bit stale,Negative
"It's very, very small, it tastes good but it's much less than its price",Negative
It was my first order and I was not very satisfied because you do not have the choice to choose the model and so on yourself and in my opinion it did not have the correct layout. I do not think it was one kilo that was brought,Negative
The quality of both pizzas was good. The volume was also good,Positive
Great hot and delicious,Positive
Decor was supposed to be changeable but it was so changeable and ugly it looked nothing like the real cake none at all but the guy who delivered the cake was very very kind and one of the best delivery guys patiently waited explained and assisted,Positive
I've purchased from Kondo pastry several times before its quality was not bad and its nuts packaging was also good now I don't know whether only its name has changed or its management has changed. Almonds were dry and it seemed the apricot kernel was dried and used instead of almond. Its packaging was not good at all. Previously they used to pour the nuts in a paper bag today the received nuts were in a closed freezer bag. I used to suggest others buy from here however I won't buy myself from this time,Negative
I have ordered two bottles of mineral water but only one was delivered!,Negative
Turkey slices had a bad smell and the food was completely cold,Negative
I have ordered from this restaurant several times and its Dizi stew was excellent I even left a comment and recommend the Dizi stew to everyone.

The pasta was very good hot and was delivered fast. The snack had an ordinary taste,Positive
Very good and suitable. I wish you could use more plastic bags (such as 2) when there are heavy and fragile items next to each other. Thank you,Positive
Chicken Tehchin was not good at all. Tehchin must be saffron flavored and must smell cardamom and rose water and the rice must be mixed with egg yolk. The rice in the Tehchin was completely soggy. It did not taste saffron at all which indicates that food coloring or safflower has been used instead. It smelled heavily of oil. Therefore we were not satisfied with the Tehchin. The Loobia polo stew was good the kebab was also ordinary. I cannot recommend it. Therefore I do not recommend Tehchin and Koobideh at all. However Loobia polo was good,Negative
The food smelled a lot like leftover oil,Negative
The quality of bread and delivery were very good. One question though. Why if both breads are sent in one package do you charge a separate packaging cost for each one?!,Positive
"It was really great in every aspect: Flavor, size, quality, packaging, delivery time. God bless you",Positive
The quality of food was really bad compared to the prices. Only the steak chili sandwich was good,Negative

The stew was more like a bean meal. They had added some vegetables and meat to it,Negative

All the ingredients they used were very good but the sweetness of the bread really bothered me,Negative
Everything was good but the pizza was totally cold,Negative
The requested items were not taken into account at all. The packaging was super bad and the sandwich smelled bad,Negative
The amount paid does not match the invoice,Negative

"Unfortunately, the food was almost cold",Negative
"The chicken was cooked very poorly and it was clear that it had been a few days since it was cooked because it was tough and its taste had changed. All in all, it was one of the worst zereshk polos I’ve ever tried",Negative
"The food was delivered cold. To the extent that all the cheese in the sandwich stuck to the paper around the sandwich and was dry. Overall, for some time now Snapp Food has not provided a good service at all!!!",Negative
The taste of Shuleh Ghalamkar was not good and this was definitely the last order from this restaurant,Negative
On time and perfect. Good luck,Positive

"It was really really bad! What kind of vitamins were they, really?!",Negative
"The pizza was made with fresh ingredients and had no stale smell. The bread was thin and full of ingredients, and the potatoes were fresh with no smell of old oil. All in all, it was excellent",Positive
"It was awful. I mean, if one wants to pay money and take the risk of Corona, it's better to drink water instead of food. Cold, tasteless, raw dough",Negative
"The window pizza was cold when I received it, and it was not satisfactory for the price",Negative
"The food was cold, of very poor quality, and the meat smelled. Afterwards, we felt sick. Before, the burgerator was very good, but the last two times I ordered, it was really bad",Negative
"The amount of potatoes and fillet was small for the price. The quality of the fillet was good, but the volume of the food was small",Negative
"The taste of cumin was dominant, and there was very little chicken. It said 700 grams of rice and 300 grams of chicken, but at best, it had 300 grams of rice and 100 grams of chicken",Negative
"This time, unfortunately and unfortunately, the rice was not cooked",Negative
"As always, excellent. Since I found Pizza Dart, I haven't ordered from anywhere else. The quality and presentation of the products and the attention to the customer's requests are some of their positive points. The only drawback that can be pointed out is that the pizzas get cold upon delivery, which I hope will be fixed",Positive
I ordered for the second time. The quality and taste of their food are really excellent. I hope it always stays this way,Positive
It arrived very quickly and on time. Thank you,Positive
"Everything was good and acceptable compared to the prices, but it could have been better. But overall, thank you. The things that I had written in the description were done. Thank you",Positive
Everything was excellent. Thank you for your good food,Positive
"It was really bad, we all got a stomachache, and the volume of chips, cheese, and pizza was very, very low, although with that low quality, it was better that the volume was low",Negative
"It took two hours to send the wrong order. In the end, the delivery boy came and said, ""Let me see what order I brought,"" then forty minutes later, he brought a pizza. I had invited guests, and I lost face. They brought half of the food. What a shame",Negative
I'm really sorry; all the ingredients inside the spring roll were burnt,Negative

"The quality was very good. The food did not get cold despite the distance. Thank you to Alparo for preparing the food quickly, and to Snappfood for delivering it quickly",Positive
"We were very surprised. After opening the box, a month had not passed since the last order, everything in this pizza had reduced. The size had become very small. The ingredients used are of the same quality as before, but they have been halved, so much so that a few centimeters around the pizza is just empty bread. I wish you would raise the price but not give this poor pizza to people. I don't even recommend it to anyone, even with a discount",Negative
"It wasn't good at all and the thing that was shown on the menu wasn't sent. To fill the box, one type of cookie was used which was very large and had a lot of volume and a lot of weight, so the box was partially empty. The variety of cookies was very little; only the name was exclusive. I'm truly sorry",Negative
The sour chicken kebab meal was awful and tasteless and its weight isn't even 150 grams darling; you noted 220 grams,Negative
I had never before eaten head and foot so tasteless; it was really horrible,Negative
What's the meaning of this? You brought me soda but it had completely frozen,Negative
It was delicious; I enjoyed it; thank you,Positive
There was no breaded chicken wing in the basket,Negative
"After all this, you don't even take the trouble to read the customers' comments; at least give good service to the customers. Neither a spoon nor a fork; everyone knows that barberry is necessary with chelow kebab. I'm truly sorry",Negative
"Thank you to the restaurant manager; the food's taste and flavor were excellent and its amount was sufficient. Best of all, the food was delivered to me quickly and on time. I only ask that you cook the chicken a little more",Positive
"Instead of regular fat cheese, they sent low-fat diet cheese. If there's going to be a discrepancy every time, it's no longer possible to trust you to emphasize to your delivery people that they need to check the order against the invoice",Negative
"The mashed potatoes with cheese had a strange sour taste that was not appetizing. I thought the milk in the mashed potatoes had gone bad. I think it would be better to make them without cheese or with a different flavor of cheese. The sandwich was very spicy, but delicious",Negative
Two ice cream cones were in the order and they didn't bring them,Negative
The food was incredibly excellent and delightful. I'm very sorry that I hadn't known about Qajary Restaurant until now. I will definitely be one of this restaurant's regular customers and I recommend it to others. The food's quality is excellent and its price is reasonable. I also thank Snapp Food for delivering the food to me warm and quickly,Positive
"The rice was cold although it's not even a five-minute walk from the source to the destination. The rice was really low quality. If you had served Indian rice, it would have been better than what they sent. The chicken was good",Negative
"It's always good: fast, hot, and delicious",Positive

The image that was posted is very different from what I received,Negative
The delivery guy was polite. The bean polo was a little bland. The tahchin was excellent,Positive
It arrives quickly; this store places it accurately; but the variety of products on its site is very limited,Negative
"Every time we ordered, we faced a shortage from the supermarket. Every time we reminded them, but the supermarket still had a shortage in the shipments, and the amount was returned to the account. This negligence of the supermarket lowers your quality and causes a loss of points from Snapp Food. Also, it causes less or no purchases from your supermarkets",Negative
The drink was very warm when delivered,Negative
The burger bread was very dry,Negative
The chicken was floating in a lot of oil,Negative

"The food was of sufficient quantity and quality, but unfortunately, it was too salty",Negative

"They delivered very quickly, thank you",Positive
"First of all, I had ordered a one-kilo chocolate cake, but I received a half-kilo Nutella cake, and because of excessive shaking, half of the cake was crushed. Thank you very much",Negative
"We received the fruits at a very suitable time, but the watermelon was rotten and unripe",Negative
I did not like the taste of the breadcrumbs used in the food,Negative
"Hello, I asked for a high-protein diet, they sent a regular one. I wanted a specific flavor of Bombas, they sent two different types of their choice. I wanted Mirinda, they did not send it at all. They sent its money back in cash!!! Last time, instead of chocolate biscuits, they had sent plain biscuits. All these items were sent without coordination and with a delay of 40 minutes!!! I am really disappointed with the last two orders...",Negative
"The delivery time was very long! Did it really take 1 hour to prepare it?!! But the delivery guy was so polite and respectful that it eased the shortcomings of the restaurant a bit. However, the quality of the food was good. Please manage the preparation time a bit",Negative
Quality was acceptable but not great,Negative

Give the chef a thousand tomans more so that he pays attention and doesn't burn the lentils,Negative

It was cold even in the hottest part of summer,Negative

He didn't send them, instead of the requested canola oil from Lادن, he sent a different oil. I will not order from this supermarket again. The issue was resolved by calling support.",Negative
One was sent less. Please follow up.,Negative

"Wrapping of vegetables was torn, I returned it but it didn't arrive on time for our lunch",Negative
"When we received the order, the pastries were a bit mixed up",Negative

Chicken portion was very small and most of it was young chicken instead of a full roast chicken without any garnishes.. Its taste was average and the only positive thing is that it didn't smell bad,Negative
"As always, hot dog sandwiches were perfect, and the chicken sandwich was perfect and delicious.

They're really professional both in terms of food and customer care. Thanks to Snapp Food for introducing good restaurants to people.,Positive
I didn't like it very much.,Negative
They didn't put any sauce with the sandwich.,Negative

"The order arrived very fast and on time, thanks to Haida and Snapp Food dear.",Positive
"They had not paid attention to the explanation that we wanted less zoolbia and they had put two types of zoolbia and a lot of it. The goshefil and bamieh were so full of syrup that they were dripping and it upset the stomach. Overall, it was not good.",Negative
"Good quality, arrived fast, hot and warm.",Positive
"The fries were too cooked, but overall it was good and the food was delivered warm, but too much time had been spent on cooking the food.",Positive
Very fast and accurate.,Positive

"The quality and taste of the roast beef sandwich was not good, the other dishes were relatively of very good quality and taste, which, of course, the delay in delivery and the coldness of the food and the disorder of the pizzas in the box reduced the desirability of our order.",Negative

The delivery time for food is too long!!!,Negative
What do you mean you didn't put any sauce ?!,Negative
Everything was great and it was delivered quickly thank you step food,Positive
"I really do not understand why this restaurant has such a high rating. The name of the food it offers is fast food but it takes much longer than traditional foods to prepare! After 45 minutes, if I hadn't reported on the app, I doubt the food would be ready by now, and as soon as it was announced that the food would not arrive, the food arrived after 10 minutes, which shows a lack of coordination that is not the first time. The sandwich was extremely low quality. There wasn't an ounce of creativity in it and it uses ordinary and chewy baguette. It says in the menu that it has a special sauce, while it's a lie and other than cheese, it doesn't have any other attractive factor. Regardless of the fact that the pizza has become smaller to maintain its price, it was very stale and of poor quality, and there was no sign of cream. I am willing to pay for expensive food but to be able to trust the menu and know exactly what I am eating. Not like this, low quality. We ordered two of the most popular foods and this was it! Very, very weak and low quality.",Negative
The Barbari bread was not fresh... The quality of the omelet was very low,Negative

"Very good, thank you Snapp Food",Positive
"Calamari sauce has a lot of garlic, which would be better if it was less",Negative

"Very good, clean and generous. God bless your business",Positive
"The taste and appearance of the food was good, but the quality of the chicken was not good and it was very raw. I hope in the next orders there will be more attention to the quality of the chicken used and its proper cooking",Negative
The size of the pizzas was much lower than my expectations. I thought I'd have at least 8 pieces and could fill me up,Negative

"Amazing, but I hope the prices get a bit closer to the fruit market",Positive
Some of the mushroom burger was raw,Negative
"I had ordered Gheymeh, but Gheymeh Bademjan was delivered. The food tasted very bad. It was like food served in the army and in the university. Overall, I was very, very upset. I am not ordering food from Islami anymore",Negative
"It was not Tabriz Qurabiye at all and they had just sprinkled some almonds on top, while the reason Qurabiye is expensive is because instead of flour, they use almond powder, which was not the case here at all",Negative

"As good as always, the potato with cheese and mushrooms was great, hot and fast",Positive

"Despite the fact that I wrote in the details not to send cutlery, surprisingly I saw that for 2 burgers they had sent 4 pairs of cutlery and napkins and each one had separate plastic packages. Meaning an order from Burgerland for me is equal to a crime against the environment. It's really sad",Negative
"Everything was good, the food arrived on time, the quality was also good. Overall everything was satisfying because I've ordered from this restaurant before. I suggest everyone to at least try it",Positive
"Tell the delivery guys not to press that they've delivered the order before actually delivering it, because the delivery guy had gone to the wrong place and his mobile was out of reach, but I waited and he found the address himself.

"I think the quality of this food has declined: It didn't have any mashed potato!!! It had lavash bread instead of sangak bread, and before they shaped the rice in a special way, but now they just pour it in the dish. And the quality of the kebab has also declined and the delivery guy wanted to take a ton of money!!! Which I don't think is logical. I called and they said they're going to solve the issue with the delivery guy. All in all, I expected more from this restaurant and I hope that it wouldn't decline like many other Iranian restaurants",Negative

"The pizza pasta was so sweet that we couldn't eat it at all. Maybe they had added a lot of ketchup to the soy and that's why it was so sweet. The halftone or roast beef pizza was not anything special either, it had no special flavor and seemed a bit stale. They also had added so much turmeric to the pizza's bread that it was very yellow and did not taste good. Their packaging was good but overall I was not satisfied at all",Negative

"If I have to give an overall review, your foods and cafe are great. But if I was to be particular and meticulous, the mojito was very good, I had previously tried it with sour cherry, but with strawberry it was unique and cool. The Krakow panini was really tasty, delicious and generous. The seafood pasta was a very interesting combination, the shrimps were well marinated and they were great along with the alfredo sauce. The special potato was a complete, large and delicious dish by itself. Just 2 things, one is the extra sauces that you put, in my opinion, are very normal and less compared to the price, If you could add special spices or garlic or smoked flavor it would be more unique.

The temperature of the food was low and it had completely cooled down,Negative

The name King is also not suitable for a regular double burger in any restaurant",Negative
"The sweets were very good, but the order was delivered very late, and the result of the follow-ups from the support team was contradictory. One expert said that the courier was on the way, and another said that it had not yet been delivered to the courier. The courier's route to the pastry shop is long!!!

"The steak pizza, which I think had only seen steak in passing, but the mixed pizza wasn't bad. Overall we ordered the 28 cm size to make sure we were full, but the only difference with the 22 cm size was that they seemed to have stretched out the dough so that it would fit in the pan, otherwise the amount of filling wasn't even up to the standard of the 22 cm.

"They did not send the salad, they reduced the number of sauces to one, and they did not look at the special requests. I had asked for the soda to be orange but they sent Coca-Cola, it seems that they gave a negligible discount and cut corners to make up for it. I don't know why the quality of good restaurants is decreasing on Snapp Food!!",Negative

"Excellent, very fresh, high quality, and delicious, thank you Nakhlk for your customer service.",Positive

The food was cold, the kebabs were salty, the rice was not cooked well and was not properly steamed, and in my opinion, it was foreign rice and very low quality. The vegetables were wilted, the motorcycle courier did not know Tehran at all, did not know where Park-e-Vi is, and went completely the wrong way. The restaurant and Snapp Food have learnt only to apologize for customer care and customer service. If you really wanted to solve the problem, which I don't think was your aim, when you found out the motorcycle courier had gone to the wrong address, you should have prepared the order again at that moment and sent it quickly by another courier. In the end, it was very awful.",Negative

"Due to the delivery time, the pizzas were cold. If smaller pieces of vegetables (especially broccoli) were used in vegetarian pizza, it would be better.

The chicken was not cooked at all,Negative

"First of all, I want to thank the courier who delivered the food on time and very quickly, the light pizza with good ingredients was good and was not oily and full of cheese, but there were some problems with the food that I think it was not good 1- the pizza ingredients were very very less. I felt like I was eating bread and tomato. In half a pizza there were about 3 slices of thin meat and 4 slices of thin sausage, the rest were olives and tomatoes, and the food had no taste at all. I figured out the taste of the bread from the food. 2- Mojito was 100% frozen and useless. I didn't eat it because it was all frozen, which was not interesting at all. 3- The first order coupon stated that mojito and chocolate are included with the food, but there was no chocolate, overall I was not satisfied with my order, and only the low cheese and low fat were good, and the fast delivery, I did not like the rest and I prefer Do not buy pizza from this restaurant again.

"The pizza garlic sauce was not sent. It may save you some costs, but it affects the taste of the food for the customer. (Do not say that it should have been specified when ordering, because garlic sauce had been sent with the pizza in the past.) Unlike the previous time, the veggie pizza had large pieces of onion that were not suitable for pizza, they were more fit for kebab. Fries or mashed potatoes? Fries have a specific definition!

"Honorable manager of Chiz Food, your pizza was really low in volume, so that one person cannot get full with a single portion. It was so light that when the delivery boy handed me the pizza, I expected mini pizzas. If I want to compare it with better quality pizzas, your pizza was really not worth buying because it is very very expensive; I prefer to pay 10,000 tomans more for this type of pizza and eat a tastier, larger pizza; a pizza with your taste and quality is offered for 22,000 tomans in some places, please do some research",Negative

I had also ordered from this restaurant before. It was very high quality. Unfortunately, it was nothing like before.",Negative
"From the first day this restaurant opened, I was a customer. The quality was really good. It included the quality of the chicken and the quality and amount of food. But now, in the last two or three orders, the quality has dropped. Even though the price has increased, the size of the chicken pieces has gotten very small. I always used to get jumbo chicken 9 pieces was enough for the family, but now the size of the pieces has gotten so small that it's not enough. The quality has dropped and the price has gone up. That was the last time I ordered food from here. I don't recommend buying from this restaurant again at all.

"It didn't only have gombo, it also had jalebi in it, and each one had such a lot of syrup that it made the sweet feel heavy, and it tasted average… The cake roll was fresh, but it had something very sweet on it that tasted like sugar and made a huge difference, and they said on the phone that the cake was 7 tomans more expensive. It was an average experience. The delivery guy didn't bring the sweets upstairs because the elevator was broken, and despite the arrangement with Snapp and me, he was forced to leave them on the ground floor… I could have just not answered the phone so that he was forced to bring them upstairs, but during Ramadan I didn't want to bother him, even though he was being demanding, but it wasn't his fault",Positive

The delivery guy was really rude,Negative
It tasted really bad and the delivery guy didn't behave properly,Negative

"Bad taste and no quality, especially the rice and meat",Negative
It didn't have any cabbage salad. And there was less potato than usual,Positive

"Please pay attention to the descriptions, if you don't have an item, don't replace it with another brand.",Positive
I think 50 minutes to deliver a roast chicken (which is usually ready and should be taken out of the oven) is too much!!!!! The size of the chicken was very small compared to its price.,Negative
"Caesar salad was a lettuce salad with burnt chicken, which I took a picture of ... There wasn't even any croutons in it. The pizza was completely doughy",Negative
"SnappFood does its job well, the order and accuracy is very good, Snapp has managed to find its place in the internet industry in Iran, it is unrivaled in my opinion, I thank its good managers, I saw their group up close and they are all young, there were no such opportunities in our time, thank you very much for providing convenience and taking a share of technology, the food was good, delicious, excellent, reasonably priced, fast and the courier was very polite and tidy",Positive

"The potato chips lacked a mushroom sauce and was a small potato without any extras, although such chips have a maximum price of 6 tomans, not 10 tomans. I ask SnapFood to follow up.",Negative
It would have been better to use a cloth or paper bag for the bread. And the delivery charge is very high for this short distance.,Negative
The turkey pizza was great.,Positive
"If possible, instead of using an aluminum dish, use the same bowls used for stew and meatballs to send eggplant puree. This way, it is better served to the customer. My food was completely and completely crushed, the oil was spilled, and the other dishes in my order were also dirty. Overall, the eggplant puree was very, very salty.

"Great, high-quality, fresh. Fast delivery. Thank you.",Positive
"Please review the requests. I ordered without pickles, which was full of pickles.",Negative
"Thank you very much, the taste is good because it is stewed and it was clean and does not have any stale taste at all. At first, you had entered a lower price of 68 Tomans, but after placing the order, about 20 Tomans were added to the price.",Positive
"Stale pastries and the cream in the middle of the pastries was frozen, it's really sad.",Negative

"They did not send the Biscochito Figaro, instead they had put 2000 tomans in the package, obviously, I didn't need it otherwise I would have ordered it. If an item is out of stock, remove it from the list, they didn't even call me to inform me. The milk's production date is December 16th, and the expiration date is December 21st. Today is December 18th. Yes, it has not expired, but milk should have a current production date. If I wanted to get milk from 2 days ago, I would have gotten it from my small local supermarket, which is small and most of its products are old. The production date of the yogurt is December 9th. Yes, yogurt also has an expiration date, but it should be current. So, this super busy supermarket has not received yogurt in 9 days. A supermarket that works with Snapp Food definitely receives many orders, so its products should have a current production date, especially milk and yogurt. Thank you to Snapp Food, I hope that these issues will be resolved",Negative

"For the third order, the Varus burger was again excellent ... The volume of french fries was very high and did not taste like oil, and in every way, even the appearance, was excellent ... The roast beef sandwich was also cooked perfectly and tasted very good, This is so much in the sandwich that it was too much for one person !!! The management of this restaurant is very good, ..., Because of the high cost of the market, the quality and volume of materials have not been reduced ... Hopefully, in subsequent orders, we will witness this good quality ... Good luck",Positive
"The food was received two hours after the order, after two registrations, and was very cold. The food pick was placed on the building guard and had gone without any contact, and with the delay and follow-up, only 15 minutes were added to the delivery time. Obviously, no one had followed up on the cause of the delay the first time",Negative
"The speed of the pick is excellent and for this reason, congratulations to Snapp ... only the cost of the pick is high ... but I have to say about the supermarket itself, it has everything and all of them have a reasonable expiration date ... between the surrounding supermarkets, I think it's better than everyone else ... Really their score is excellent ... Don't hurt your hand ... God bless you",Positive

"The order arrived after an hour. Again, one of my orders (sliced cheese) was not brought. I thought that when it takes so long, at least my order would be correct.",Negative
"Firstly, the food came late after an hour and a half, and when it came, they delivered the wrong food.

Now I have to wait another hour for them to bring me cold food.",Negative

They did not send me the Mirza Ghasemi yogurt that I ordered, and they did not even call to return the money to me. I also said that the soda should be Coca-Cola, which it was not. The kebab was sour and the food arrived cold. This cold arrival has nothing to do with poor Snappfood because they delivered very quickly. When the restaurant is close and the food arrives cold, it means that they sent it cold themselves, not that poor motorcyclist who thinks of two bites of bread.",Negative
"The steak pizza was the worst pizza I've ever had, it was bad, the pepperoni pizza was not bad. The pizza was completely crushed in the box and stuck to the box.",Negative

I ordered a kashk eggplant sandwich before, which was delivered warm to me, but this time the kashk eggplant dish was completely cold, meaning that it was sent to me from the refrigerator. Two kashks should be sent with each dish, and I ordered an additional two kashks, which is 4 kashks, but none of them were sent. Also, the eggplant was put in the container, probably because they were tired and did not have the patience to pound it. It was really terrible",Negative

"Due to the delay in food delivery, it was very cold and disappointing",Negative
"1. In the picture, the food is with lemon, pepper, etc., but it is served with onion. 2. It was very greasy and oily. 3. The packaging was not suitable at all, although 1500 was the packaging cost, it was terrible overall.",Negative

"I have been eating pizza for more than 30 years, I have tried all the pizzas until I got to the giant pizza. I have to say that the previous pizzas were all misunderstandings, but the important thing is to stay with the same quality, not that later because of increasing the price of materials they must lower the quality. Everything was proportionate and proportionate, especially the cheese, which was not used excessively despite the large volume of ingredients. If only there was an app that is completely sausage-free, there would be no problem at all",Positive

The pastries were stale and stuck together! And too much sugar had been added to it!,Negative

"Because of my own mistake I didn't pay attention to the address and after 3 minutes I called and although I canceled the order they said it's not possible, we'll send it to the same place you are. Then they said it's not possible and I said OK, send it to the same old place to the address that you sent it wrong. After 5 hours the food is delivered. It's not the restaurant's fault. Snapp Food's follow up was awful and bad. The behavior was completely inappropriate. I request a refund",Negative

We will never order anything from Sheila again",Negative

"The quality of the hallo cheese fries was really bad. Firstly, when the delivery guy brought it, its lid was open and it had spilled into the packaging and all its contents had spilled out of its container. Secondly, its quality was really bad. The cheese was not cheese at all, it was white pieces between the minced meat. The sauce was so salty and sour that we completely discarded the sauce and ate the potatoes plain. It was really strange from Sheila. The hot dog was also so salty that half of it was barely eaten. I will definitely not choose Sheila for a second purchase",Negative
"I ordered two chuckles snacks and instead you delivered a mazm. I added in the description that the drinks should be cold, but unfortunately mineral water and soda were delivered completely warm. Ice cream was also delivered as a smoothie",Negative

Thank you, I'll order from this confectionery again",Positive
"Every day the size and measurements of your food are getting smaller, but the price is increasing. At least if you are going to increase the price, don't change the size and amount of food. This caused me to not order food from Perprok anymore; for the same price, I can get more pizza",Negative

"Even though Foodparty has been satisfied to give a greater discount, that is no reason to put all the unsold rolls and bad color schemes! Why do you deliver specially branded packaging to in-person customers and a simple cardboard with no name or address for delivery? Maybe someone wants to take it as a souvenir, it's not appropriate like that. I hope you will pay attention to these issues",Negative

Unfortunately, Snappfood support not only failed to do anything about it, but was inherently out of order, always !!! And except for a simple apology, he does nothing. Calling the restaurant directly does not work because 1) they do not connect to the branch 2) they only have colorful excuses for being late, and with the sentence ""Do you know why"", they always end the matter. Please follow up completely from both Snapp Food and the management of the Baruj complex !!!! There is a limit to excuses",Negative

And that the salad's own sauce, which is usually Caesar sauce, was not included with the food? Why? Didn't Burgertor get the money, so why is it less? Why should the customer pay in full but the restaurant doesn't bring the whole order? They should come and eat that amount of lettuce dry and empty themselves!!! Secondly, the fried chicken was dampened because it was left by the salad and its taste changed and the salad was partly spoiled and runny due to the heat of the chicken. These should be separate. In short, I always order salad and I don't buy such a thing anymore.",Negative

It was not a good cheese at all! I do not care about the melting part! When eating I felt like I was eating boiled egg white! It did not taste like cheese at all! In terms of its appearance and flavor! Although the food arrived quickly and warm, the cheese was hard and was off-putting, especially in the fries and cheese, and its taste was not good at all!

Does it really take 40 minutes to prepare four pieces of chips?,Negative

They fry and put it in the sandwich, but this one had a lot of bell pepper instead of onion and parsley, which should be in the kebab. Instead, there was only low quality cucumber and tomato. Even a score of one was too much for this sandwich.",Negative
"The pizza arrived very quickly, but it was completely cold. In addition, chicken fillet was not used, and it was definitely a poor quality and stiff chicken breast that reduced the pizza score to half.

My carrot juice tasted like carrot ice cream! 2- Three of the four scoops of ice cream that I got were not what I wanted (banana instead of banana chocolate and bubble gum instead of blueberry - I don't remember the third one) - I wish this option was available through the app So that you can choose from what you have in stock 3- The names of the juices were not labeled on them either (except one which was also a mistake from one of my other bottles) which makes it difficult to differentiate some of them (such as sweet and mulberry juice) from each other But apart from that, the overall quality of your products is good and I had also purchased in person Good luck",Positive

"This is the second time I’ve ordered Sangak bread; the first time it was great, but this time they had cut the bread into pieces so that the size of the bread would not be obvious. I put the pieces next to each other and saw that my guess was correct and the bread was smaller than the usual size.

Even there was no sign of the usual packaging, which included a knife, a fork, a tissue, and a mini bread, and there was just a fork! The main reason for me to order crispy strips was the Thai sauce and the low-oil food, but this time you didn't put the Thai sauce and even though the distance from the burger place to my house was very close, the food was both cold and oily. Please remove the discount on the crispy strips, but when you make your customers used to good quality and do your branding, don't ruin the quality of the food.
